 mexico.5.d: "Federal Police have been deployed in mass numbers across our border with the United States. Thousands of American refugees have been detained as they flee from the choas embroiling the entire nation. Officials estimate there are thousands more crossing into our borders each night. There is no doubt that former coyotes smuggling our people into America are doing the same for these refugees and will continue until the conflict is resolved. We suspect cartels are also active in the region, exploiting poor families and trafficing them into their business. The army is soon to be deployed in larger numbers to assist the overwhelmed officers."
