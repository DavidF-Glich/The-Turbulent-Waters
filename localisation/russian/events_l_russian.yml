 decision_event.1.t: "Taiwan Policy"
 decision_event.1.d: "The Peoples' Republic of China has since its inception viewed the self-proclaimed Republic of China, situated on Taiwan, with mistrust at best and open hostility at worst. Both countries continue to claim to be one true legitimate representative of China and heir to the Chinese national heritage and history. Both countries are still in frosty diplomatic relations at and times in diplomatic talks with each other, having agreed upon the 'One China principle':\n\nBoth governments agree that there is only and exactly one nation of China with a unified national identity and people and both governments agree that this exactly one nation of China has exactly one government that is legitimate.\n\nThe thing that their 'consensus' has no actual consensus on is which of the governments is the legitimate one. Both countries, in Taiwan's case sometimes depending on the ruling party, refuses to uphold diplomatic relations with a nation that upholds diplomatic relation with the other China. Due to especially the PRC's incredible international outreach and importance as a market, this is a discussion that every country MUST have a position on. We need to make a choice.\n\n(This decision will last for the next five years, after which you can choose to renew your current choice or switch to the other government.)"

 decision_event.2.d: "Palestine and Israel have been at odds since the two countries' formations in 1948. After an aggressive war of Palestine and its allies against Israel, which Israel ended up winning, a spree of more than half a dozen military conflicts as well as several muslim revolts on Israeli territories were unleashed.\n\nIsrael too cannot claim complete innocence, actively encouraging its citizens to settle on territory that is internationally recognized as Palestinian in order to manipulate the demographics as well as starting preventive wars against its neighbors (for example in 1967).\n\nBut there is one fact that makes this issue even more complicated: Palestine is not a UN member state. Recognizing it as a country is not a no-brainer, as it would pose an immediate an lasting insult to Israel and Israel's supporters. Israel on the other hand is not recognized by dozens of - primarily muslim - UN member states as well. Refusing to support Palestine would surely offend some people in the greater Middle East.\n\nOur nation has to take a stand."

Конституционалистское правительство или юнионистское правительство еще не подтвердило, что эти подразделения являются какими-либо известными группами спецназа, но они имеют американскую военную технику и американские опознавательные знаки."
