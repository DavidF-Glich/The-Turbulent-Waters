 china.wuhan.d: "The heavy clouds obscured the sky, barely allowing the outlines of the city below to be seen. Neon lights occasionally tinted the clouds purple or orange-yellow.\n\nHowever, Chen Zihua, seated inside the Y-20 transport aircraft, couldn't see any of this. As the plane roared through its descent, he nervously recalled the events of four hours earlier. Awakened by the emergency bell, he had quickly rolled out to hear the commander's speech. He and his comrades had been chosen as the first group to support Wuhan. After hastily writing a letter to his family-possibly a farewell letter-these young men, along with boxes of medical supplies, had crossed half of China to reach the disaster-stricken city.\n\nUnder the flickering lights, Chen silently observed his comrades. \"Big Tiger\" could sleep soundly even on the bumpy plane; \"Hammer\" was tightly clutching a photo in his chest pocket, probably of his girlfriend. The instructor, sitting closest to the cabin door, his eyebrows relaxed and eyes bright, full of vigor. Leading the team into a risky task seemed to him just another drill at the training ground. Looking at his calm face, Chen felt his own fear slowly dissipate.\n\nThen, with a dull thud, the landing gear touched the runway, and the plane landed heavily. Before it had even come to a complete stop, the soldiers began to get up, organizing their gear and gathering supplies. The cabin door slowly lowered, and the instructor stood up and turned to the troops, shouting in the loudest voice: \"Comrades...\""

 china.9.d: "More than four decades have passed since the fall of the Gang of Four and the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the People's Republic of China has continued to make great achievements after Mao's death. Instead of continuing the political system of the Mao era, Deng Xiaoping adopted a more pragmatic approach, which later became known as socialism with Chinese characteristics. State-owned enterprises were privatized and the new economic policies of the new era began. Later, under Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, China embarked on the path of peaceful rise through business and globalization. After Xi Jinping took over the top leadership in 2012, this course changed. Xi's Communist Party and China are not hiding their strengths and biding their time, but developing national defense capabilities and patriotism/nationalism to ensure their great power status. Despite its progress, China has not been able to win the \"international acclaim\" that the United States enjoyed in the 20th century. From its handling of the anti-extradition bill movement in Hong Kong to its continued hostility with the insurgent regime in Taiwan, the outside world's evaluation of Beijing has become extremely complicated, and even as the Chinese government uses state means to control public opinion, criticism of the Communist Party has never ended. \n\nAnd now, with the arrival of the Year of the Rat, the People's Republic of China finds itself in an unprecedented change. The United States, an ugly hegemonic country and a trading partner enjoying countless resources, will collapse if it disintegrates, and a \"new order\", or an era of true peace and freedom, will be ready. Although Moscow, New Delhi and Brussels are still potential competitors of Beijing, at present, there are both crisis challenges and unlimited opportunities."

 china.10.t: "Political Opinions in China"
 china.10.d: "Although the Chinese government has always avoided civil political discussions, privately, people's views on Chinese politics can be roughly divided into four major factions:\n\nEstablishment: A group that hopes the country will move forward steadily. Most of them are ordinary people who are not so concerned about Zhongnanhai affairs and government reports but have benefited from Xi Jinping's reforms.\n\nLiberals: Most of them are very yearning for real and transparent democratic procedures and free market economy. They hope to make drastic reforms in China's economy, society and politics, hoping to achieve democratization.\n\nNeo-Left: They are more critical of Deng Xiaoping and the attitude of Reform and Opening up, and hope to attach more importance to social fairness, partially or completely restore the public ownership of production relations and the superior status of workers. \n\nNationalists: They are more radical in their foreign views than China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and official propaganda. They advocate a tougher stance against irresponsible \"militarism resurgence\" Japan and the vicious United States. \n\nXi Jinping himself has a lot of connections with the four major factions: his status as the top leader, his deep hatred of corruption, his different evaluations of the \"Cultural Revolution\" and his emphasis on national defense and dignity determine that he can have considerable supporters in any faction. Therefore, the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping can move in any direction-as long as the Communist Party, the government and he can act in unison."

 china.18.d: "After the beginning of autumn, Yixing, Jiangsu Province was hot and humid. In the canteen of the Experimental Primary School under repair, more than a dozen ceiling fans were running at full capacity, barely bringing a hint of coolness. On both sides of the corridor leading to the operation room, the list of members of the safety production leading group headed by Chen Ke and the relevant system were still hung on the wall. \nJust two months ago, Chen Ke, the secretary of the general party branch and the principal of the school, was detained by the Yixing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision for suspected serious violations of discipline and law. Upon investigation, Chen Ke took advantage of his position and conspired with the food supplier to embezzle public funds by falsely issuing supply orders and supply invoices for off-book expenses, which seriously squeezed the students' food expenses. According to Gao Hong, director of the eighth discipline inspection and supervision office of the Jiangyin Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection and Supervision, on the afternoon of May 21, 2018, pictures of poor lunch for students of Shanguan Experimental Primary School appeared in WeChat Moments. Subsequently, related posts appeared in succession on local online forums, with pictures and videos attached. The school explained that \"the chef had a physical examination, but no one cooked\", and the public opinion continued to ferment because of the perfunctory attitude. \nAfter investigation, it was found that Gong Xiujuan, then director of the General Affairs Office of Shanguan Experimental Primary School, took advantage of her position of reviewing and reporting the canteen's procurement expenses, and used 7 suppliers to issue false delivery notes and invoices for 96 times and then return the money, embezzling more than 1.3 million yuan for her personal and relatives' house purchases and consumption. Before September 1, 2017, the student lunch fee was 8 yuan per person per day, and then adjusted to 8.5 yuan. According to the calculations of the auditors, the fraud of Gong Xiujuan and others resulted in each student's 5 yuan lunch fee being squeezed out every day, \"actually only 3.5 yuan of food\". \n\"Gong Xiujuan's methods are not actually clever, and can even be said to be simple and crude. If the supervision can be stricter, it would be impossible to do it.\" Gao Hong said that it was precisely because the school canteen management was too chaotic, not only did not establish a ledger, but other staff members also took the opportunity to take advantage of Gong Xiujuan to a greater or lesser extent, turning a blind eye to Gong Xiujuan, and finally forming an unspoken community of interests."

Due to the lack of supervision and Yang's constant \"hunting\", the canteen management staff went through the motions in accepting the ingredients, and the accounting audit turned a blind eye, which gave the logistics contracting company a huge operating space. In addition to normal operations, the company also adopted methods such as false sales lists and false invoices to siphon student living allowance funds.

Mandatory environmental policies have caused irreversible decline in basic industries in many regions, and our quick success and quick profit actions have also meant that we have failed to find ways to help them recover and prosper. The return of forests means less farmland, and the clarity of water sources has led to the closure of a large number of factories. Although we have met our environmental protection targets, many people on the Internet seem to care less about the so-called \"reform results\" and more about the harm of \"bureaucracy\" reflected in them."

Soil loss caused by excessive deforestation, air and water pollution caused by heavy industry, and the extinction of many animals due to lack of supervision are all urgent problems that need to be solved. \n\nIt must be admitted that this reform has encountered a major setback, which can be described as a \"humiliating failure\". Facts have proved that many cadres in our government still think in the era of \"GDP is everything\" in the early days of Reform and Opening up, and are willing to sacrifice everything including vegetation coverage, water resources, and air quality for economic growth on paper. When the central government decides to promote reform measures, various \"supplementary opinions\" that are enough to push it back to the discussion stage will always appear \"appropriately\". Perhaps in the future, children can only see giant pandas and white-fin dolphins in museums, and citizens must bring their own N95 masks to work every day."

I think the epidemic has already...\" \n\nMy parents are still using WeChat to communicate with relatives who have not met this year. It can be seen that they are not calm. As if she had made a great determination, the mother slowly spoke, \n\n\"Maybe...

For a time, people were in panic, masks were in short supply, and the price was more than ten times the usual price. The number of bankrupt companies and the number of unemployed people reached a high point. No one knew when this situation would end, and no one knew their fate in this variable. \n\n\"I'm sorry, we are also doing things according to regulations. In difficult times, please understand...\"\n\nFaced with his anger, the man in the anti-epidemic suit just left such a sentence, and the white back of the departure looked quite bloated and tired. He shrank back into the cramped room, and the anger just now turned into despair and helplessness, and climbed onto his face. \n\nBecause he returned from the risk area, he and other people were locked in an old community, and the local government organized anti-epidemic volunteers to arrange their food and daily life to ensure their living needs-at least on the surface. During the two weeks of isolation, he did not get enough food and daily necessities. He did not know whether he could keep his job, and his family was struggling because of the home lockdown. \n\nThe increasing number of infections made the lifting of the lockdown hopeless, eroding his confidence and reason. But at night, he still opened the window as required, holding a small national flag that he had bought wholesale in one hand and shaking his mobile phone with the light turned on in the other, just like other people who were also isolated here. Led by the volunteers, weak but neat voices gathered together to sing the song \"Singing the Motherland\". At this time, several cameras were set up downstairs in the community, and several officials in ties stood next to them. \n\nThe next day, an article entitled \"Love and Warmth That Cannot Be Blocked\" was forwarded by major media."

Party members and leading cadres at all levels, especially grassroots cadres, have made many arduous efforts and played an important role in the front line of epidemic prevention and control, but the epidemic prevention and control work has also exposed the problems of formalism and bureaucracy in some places and departments. When General Secretary Xi Jinping presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee to study the next step of epidemic prevention and control, he clearly stated that \"in the work of epidemic prevention and control, we must resolutely oppose formalism and bureaucracy, and let grassroots cadres devote more energy to the front line of epidemic prevention and control\". \n\nIn view of the different nature and degree of the problems, the General Secretary put forward clear opinions on handling them: \n\nFor those who fail to implement the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee, we must dare to criticize them and order them to make immediate rectifications. \nFor those who disobey unified command and dispatch, are seriously parochial, dare not take responsibility, have a floating style, and shirk responsibility, in addition to holding the direct responsible persons accountable, the main leaders of the party and government will also be held accountable if the circumstances are serious. \nFor those who are derelict in their duties, they must be punished in accordance with discipline and law."

The buildings on the riverside seemed extremely tall compared to these tiled houses. Most other people in the urban village can only see the windows and walls of their \"neighbors\", which made him feel fortunate that his parents had the vision to rent this place more than ten years ago. Compared with his childhood memories, this place is still so unchanged, and the messy planned buildings are still rooted there (of course, a few new ones have been built), but the mud tiles on the roof have been replaced with steel tiles, and the paint on the wall has fallen off and been painted again. Even in the face of the current special period, it is the same - the community's loose control is in contrast to the almost non-existent epidemic. Although his father was temporarily unemployed due to the company restructuring caused by the economic crisis, his mother's efforts and savings over the years were enough for the family to get through this short period of hardship, and he was able to quietly complete his graduation thesis at home. \n\nThe flowers planted by his mother swayed gently in the breeze, bringing bursts of fragrance, and he suddenly felt that all this didn't seem so bad."

There's no rush for work. The most important thing is to find something you like.\" The mother came out of the kitchen with a plate of hot dishes in her hands. \n\nListening to these words that his parents have said countless times, Li Xin did not respond more. He just lay on his side on the bed, watching those short videos that were not nutritious but could soothe his tired spirit, hoping to temporarily forget the unhappiness and frustration in reality. \n\nThe small family was quiet for a while, and the news broadcast on TV had long been ignored as background sound.

With just a little guidance, these forces will grow spontaneously. Over time, they become one, regardless of you and me, and even just a slight difference in opinion will lead to a big debate and quarrel, which will eventually evolve into a scene of mutual accusations and no one can convince anyone. \n\n\"...

Closing his eyes, memories warmed his heart like fireworks in winter. \n\nAs an ordinary freight driver, he travels across the country's highways every day, rain or shine, day and night, and can't stop even during the epidemic. Unfortunately, when he went to Shanghai, he was caught up in the high-speed control caused by the epidemic, coupled with the restriction of two certificates and one code across provinces, so he was forced to stay on the highway. Twenty days passed in a flash, and he was once in despair. Although he had help from the local community and caring people to prevent him from starving to death, the stagnant odometer was tantamount to sentencing him to death for the rest of his life, until he launched a request for help on Tieba without hope. \n\nAfter sincerely expressing his difficult situation through videos and texts, he did not expect that, under the lead of an internet user, donations of twenty, forty, fifty... were deposited into his account, which was enough for him to cope with the following living expenses, and even far exceeded the salary lost due to the shutdown. In the last video post, he said that he had distributed the money to a team worker who was trapped with him.

In that most difficult week, the mother guarded her mother, and the father guarded his father, every day. Even though they were hundreds of kilometers apart, the four people's situations were unexpectedly the same at this moment.

Li Xin knew that at this time, he just needed to keep his head down and keep quiet. There was almost no one in the crowd that he could call out in his peripheral vision.

Back to the low house that I only see once a year, sitting on the plastic chair in the living room, looking at the place where Mao Zedong's portrait used to hang on the wall, memories came like a tide. In the fragments of memory, grandpa had a bad temper, but he never got angry with Li Xin; he loved drinking, and he always drank with him every time he had a meal; he had an electric bicycle that he had used for a long time, and he was still very stable when he was in his sixties or seventies... These fragments of memory gradually formed a mirror, reflecting a complete image - the image of a countryman that was very common. \n\nThe mother and her brothers and sisters packed up the relics, and their mother, who was leaning on a cane, told them something again. Then Li Xin and his mother got on the small tricycle that had not changed for 20 years and returned to city life. The tricycle with a canopy was open only at the back. Li Xin stuck his head out and vaguely saw two old people standing at the rear of the car, watching them leave with a kind face. The hunched figure in the memory gradually went away with the sound of the engine, the low house and the path became fragmented, his vision began to blur, everything was withering, and his thoughts and the countryside disappeared on the horizon."

The situation in the Taiwan Strait is becoming increasingly tense and has entered a moment of crisis, with war imminent. Crisis means danger, but also breeds opportunities. With the acceleration of Japan and Australia's aggression and the intensification of the suppression of Taiwan independence forces, the people of Taiwan have seen the true face of Taiwan independence elements who sell out their country for glory and the sinister ambitions of imperialism, and are calling for cross-strait reunification more warmly than ever before. The United States is no longer able to hinder the reunification process of the motherland. Now is the best time to liberate Taiwan. However, we should not underestimate the danger of Japan and Australia. We must respond to this war in the best state and win this war at the fastest speed, minimize the loss of people's lives and property, and show the style of the People's Liberation Army and carry forward the spirit of the People's Liberation Army. \n\n General Secretary Xi Jinping also pointed out that \"the Taiwan issue arose because of the weakness and chaos of the nation, and will surely end with the rejuvenation of the nation.\" The aggressive behavior of Japan and Australia and the separatist actions of Taiwan separatists are shameless provocations and serious threats to national sovereignty, security, and development interests. The Chinese nation is no longer the sick man of East Asia that was slaughtered a hundred years ago. We must never let the motherland and the treasure island of Taiwan be bullied again. Let us unite closely around the Party Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core, hold high the great banner of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, never forget our original aspirations, keep our mission in mind, overcome difficulties, and win this battle with rock-solid confidence, a sense of urgency, and unyielding perseverance, and contribute our solid strength to the realization of the reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation!

But this did not extinguish people's anger, but instead added a piece of dry wood to it, making the march more and more intense-then the troops were dispatched, and with the \"help\" of armored vehicles, riot shields, batons, high-pressure water cannons and tear gas, the marchers were dispersed wave after wave. \n\nThe same incident is also happening in Taiwan. Despite being blocked at every level by the Taiwan authorities, CCTV's evening news still broadcast footage recorded by reporters of Taiwan's military and police swinging dozens of sticks at the demonstrators in just a few seconds."

 china.1518.d: "The first wave of landing troops went ashore in landing craft. The positions of the Taiwan army had long been cleared by drones and missiles. The beachhead troops were not greatly hindered and were smoothly deployed on the coast. \n\nHe gradually advanced with the troops to clear the remaining positions and trenches of the Taiwan army. Just as he pulled out a Taiwanese soldier from the trench and was about to escort him to the rear team, an artillery position of the Taiwan army hidden somewhere suddenly opened fire. Several artillery shells whistled across the sky and landed on the side of his team. The thunder-like sound almost pierced his eardrums, and the tinnitus stimulated his brain. The impact force flipped him to the ground, and his body was smashed by the flying debris, leaving several blood holes. In an instant, he lost consciousness, and only heard a few faint shouts and footsteps around him in a hazy state. \n\nAfter an unknown amount of time, he realized that someone was holding his palm, and his ears finally heard the sound of gunfire gradually stopping in the distance. \n\n\"He is seriously injured and must be treated as soon as possible...\" \"He lost too much blood. Even if he was bandaged, he still kept bleeding...\"\n\nHe raised his arm, as if he wanted to grab something, and his mouth, which was clotted with blood, slowly opened, which startled the person holding his palm. \n\n\"Have we... taken it down...?\"\n\nThe soldier clenched his hand tightly, wanting to give him as much comfort and warmth as possible. \n\n\"Yes, comrades, thanks to you, the landing was successful, the vanguard position has been established, and the follow-up troops will arrive soon. Please hold on!\"\n\nHe didn't speak, opened his eyes with difficulty, looked at his comrades around him, and then remembered this blue sky that was destined to belong to the motherland. The corners of his mouth slightly grinned, and his eyelids couldn't stand the heaviness. Like his raised arm, he lost the last strength. The soldier holding his palm noticed something, and held his hand even tighter, trying desperately to wake him up,\""

 china.1519.d: "\"Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!\"\n\nZeng Weiguo certainly thought that this was an overwhelming war, but when he was really in it, he realized how naive he was. Overwhelming alone was not enough to describe this war. In the few days he was stationed in the defense, he didn't see a shadow of the so-called Communist Army. His head was covered by missiles, artillery and drones. The defenses hastily built before the war proved to be worthless. The team suffered heavy casualties. Those who were still able to move had already fled in disarray. Now he was hiding in the ruins of crushed concrete, with a leg injury. He had not eaten a drop of water or a grain of rice for two consecutive days. There was no reinforcement and no hope. \n\nHe leaned against the wall and cursed desperately at the shadow of the ruins. His thirsty throat immediately coughed, bringing some noise to the lifeless ruins. \n\nNoisy...? His ears stood up like a cat, and he poked his head out of the wall. One, two, three... Dozens of small drones were flying in his direction. Hiding back in the ruins, although he knew this was an inevitable fate, the fear of impending death still made his heart beat wildly and his face pale. The buzzing of the drone became louder and louder, closer and closer, hovering over his head...\n\nSomething fell beside him, making a metal knocking sound. He immediately closed his eyes, hugged his body, and accepted his fate. Time passed by minute by minute, the expected pain and explosion did not come, but the sound of the drone had gone away. He opened his eyes in confusion and found that what had just fallen beside him was not a bomb, but canned food and bottled water. There was also a brand new note on it:"

 china.1520.t: "A Special Lesson"
 china.1520.d: "Li Xin walked towards the classroom with a nervous pace, and repeatedly recalled the speech he had written yesterday. When he arrived outside the classroom, the head teacher was already waiting for him. The two sides just exchanged glances, and then the head teacher stepped into the classroom, \n\n\"I was supposed to teach this class meeting, but after thinking about it, it would be more appropriate for Teacher Li to teach it.\" \n\nFollowing the head teacher's words, Li Xin walked into the classroom, forced a smile to the head teacher and the students, and inserted the USB flash drive he had prepared in advance into the computer. While waiting for the computer to respond, he decided to set the atmosphere first as he had practiced countless times in his mind. \n\n\"Ahem...Students all know that Taiwan has been an inseparable part of our country since ancient times...\"\n\nEven though it was not the first time he stepped onto the podium, Li Xin's voice was still trembling with nervousness.\n\n\"In the previous class, we talked about that after the War of Liberation, the Kuomintang was defeated in Taiwan. Due to the interference of the United States, the cause of liberating Taiwan has not been completed. For a long time afterwards, we proposed the principle of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems for various considerations...\"\n\nHe opened the PPT in the folder, and a propaganda poster from the Mao era instantly covered the entire projection screen. \n\n\"General Secretary Xi has long said that 'the motherland must be unified and will inevitably be unified', but students who care about national affairs must know that Taiwan is not peaceful recently.\"\n\nHe paused and observed the students' reactions. At this time, several students had already spoken in a low voice, and then the students around them had a discussion. Seeing that the strategy was beginning to work, he clicked on the next PPT. \n\n\"Students can see that the three people standing together in the picture are the leader of Taiwan [CHI.GetLeader], the foreign minister of Japan, and the defense minister of Australia. Do you know what they are going to do? They...\"\n\nBefore he finished speaking, several students who were usually naughty and didn't like to listen to the class immediately shouted words like \"Down with the Japs\", which soon heated up the mood of the whole class, and the students started to make noises. Things didn't go as Li Xin expected. He was a little at a loss for a while, but he soon thought of a way. He signaled the head teacher not to stop the students, and he stood quietly on the podium. \n\nAfter about two or three minutes, the students finally calmed down gradually, and pairs of eyes returned to the podium again. Li Xin smiled, looked around at these half-mature, childish students, and waved at them, \n\n\"It seems that everyone is a socialist successor who cares about the world and loves the country and the people. Indeed, the tragedy of Taiwan's separation from the motherland stems from Japan's shameless invasion, the insidious obstruction of the United States and the West, and the audacity of the Taiwan independence forces, but the most fundamental reason is the weakness of the nation and the lack of national strength. Today's China has not only stood up, but also become rich and strong. The War of Liberation and the great cause of the reunification of the motherland will continue unstoppably. Tell me loudly, can you let others forcibly separate you from your brothers and sisters? Will you allow the treasure island of Taiwan to be occupied and bullied by others?\" \n\n\"No!\" \"Never!\" \n\nListening to the students' sonorous and powerful answers, Li Xin felt that he was also infected by the simple enthusiasm of the classroom. He cleared his throat and wanted to go deeper into this special class."

 china.1521.d: "After studying in Tianjin for four years, Sirius entered the summer of 2021 with a degree in software engineering from Nankai University. This science student immersed in the world of numbers and logic entered a science class with blue and white uniforms as early as high school. He was surrounded by equations and chemical formulas. The beauty and poetry of love seemed to be out of his reach - even the light-year distance of Sirius was more accessible than love. After graduation, he chose to return to his hometown of Liaoning and did program debugging work in an office building. At night, his spirit leaped into the virtual world and uploaded his own independent game live on Station B, like building an ideal utopia. \nIn 2022, Sirius' life underwent a subtle change. As the drums of the game \"Hearts of Iron 4\" sounded, he began to be busy with work during the day, and at night he became a game science program producer, reading a lot of information, writing copy, and spreading his understanding and enthusiasm for the military to more audiences. In order to balance real work and video updates, Sirius even had to adjust his update frequency. His Up master's pace was slow and firm. However, the fluctuations of fate always come quietly. At the end of 2022, Sirius's company encountered a wave of layoffs and could not escape the fate of \"optimization\". He also joined the army of unemployed. \nThis sudden unemployment brought a considerable impact. With the saturation of the talent market, finding a job has become more difficult, and economic pressure and long-term emotional vacancy have become a dilemma that he cannot ignore. However, it was in this double trough of emotion and career that Sirius really realized that what he was best at was not the daily routines full of program codes, but beating with these code elves to create new miracles. So he decided to change his career and become a full-time Up master. In the live broadcast room of Station B, he named himself \"Sirius\". This word, which comes from the brightest star in the night sky, carries his hope and persistence in life, symbolizes his cultural journey from ancient Egypt to modern times, and also reflects his pursuit of spiritual power among contemporary youth groups. \nIn two years, Sirius has experienced countless challenges and struggles, but he persisted. After spending those rough but warm days with his fans, he finally had his breakthrough - he had 100,000 fans and obtained the \"Yellow Lightning\" certification from Bilibili. This is not only an affirmation for him, but also a reward for his persistence and dedication. Although the economic pressure always exists, Sirius still firmly hopes that he can continue to devote his efforts and passion to this dream-filled self-media world before succumbing to reality."

Our army has established a solid position in Taiwan. Weapons, equipment and personnel reinforcements are being transported to the island continuously, and the combat contact line is still advancing deep into the island. Now, due to the frequent activities of Japanese and Australian submarines, it is suggested that the People's Navy should comprehensively strengthen the blockade of the north and east coasts of Taiwan Island. The reasons are as follows: First, it can prevent Japan and Australia from transporting personnel and equipment to the island and speed up the process of liberating Taiwan; second, it can prevent Taiwan independence elements from escaping and prevent them from organizing opposition forces similar to Xinjiangand Tibetan independence in foreign countries."

The country's major policies have almost no direct impact on them, even during the epidemic. They live a dull life day after day. Like countless Chinese people, on the surface, they don't care too much about politics, and try to avoid expressing their political views to strangers. But occasionally they will get together to talk about some political topics. From Chairman Mao's greatness and shortcomings, Chiang Kai-shek's cruelty and ridiculousness, to the boring tricks played by the United States, the advantages and disadvantages of various policies in the Deng, Jiang, and Hu eras, and even the changes in the social environment under Xi's rule. These topics come out of their mouths like talking about home. The views are not new, even naive, but all contain their simple emotions. \n\nWalking on the road stained red by firecrackers and straw paper, the street was no longer filled with the rustling voices of the past, but was replaced by the sound of firecrackers and fireworks from afar, as well as the broadcasting accent that had accompanied the Chinese people through countless days and nights. Passing through the pedestrians who were standing in front of the store and looking out their heads, Li Xin came to a store he often ate at. As expected, the boss was looking up at the picture on the TV screen, forgetting his arrival. \n\n\"Taiwan is finally liberated...\"\n\nLi Xin walked to the boss's side, also looking up at the TV, and couldn't help but say this. The boss was startled and stood up, but he still had a smile on his face. \n\n\"Yeah, what to eat?\"\n\n\"The same as before.\"\n\nThe same as before? When Li Xin came back to his senses, he was holding a bowl of noodles in his hand. The hot steam with fragrance blew on his cheeks. He picked up the chopsticks and was stunned for several seconds. The gorgeous fireworks continued to bloom in the sky outside, but the food and the sound of fireworks in front of him did not enter his mind. Something different rose and emerged in his heart. Yes, Taiwan was liberated, but it had no effect on him and the people here. Life was still repetitive and boring day after day. Why did people become happy? Why did his heart become so hot that it kept beating? He thought of the lesson he had taught to the students before, but he still didn't understand where this emotion between him and the people came from, but there was at least one thing he could be sure of:"

 china.1526.d: "For Zeng Weiguo, the Taiwan Strait War ended so peacefully: first, the position was destroyed by long-range strikes, then surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, was escorted to the rear, and stayed there until the end of the war. All this seems to be just yesterday, but he has more important memories that he wants to remember. \n\nFollowing the traces of the family letter, Zeng Weiguo returned to Guangzhou. He was not used to the travel and payment habits of the mainland. Fortunately, the Taiwan Resident Card brought him a lot of convenience. However, since the village described in the letter had long been renamed, he still took a lot of effort and went to many places before finally finding the village that once existed only in the family letter and his grandfather's oral description. \n\nThe former village has become a small town, and the iconic banyan tree still stands there, just as described in the family letter and grandfather. The difference is that there are two more small banyan trees next to the big banyan tree. Their branches extend to the residential buildings next to them, and the lush leaves are like open green velvet umbrellas. Incense was burning under the banyan tree, leisurely old men were resting and playing chess on the stone benches under the banyan tree, children were playing with sand under the shade of the tree, and crisp bird calls could be heard from time to time above their heads...\n\nAn inexplicable emotion surged in his heart, and Zeng Weiguo just stood there in a daze, looking at this hometown he had never met with moist eyes, as if time had stopped at this moment."

 china.1528.d: "Li Xin has never felt happy at work - well, in fact, there are occasional happy times, such as when a student seriously asks him about history, and when he gets paid. But working overtime on weekends is definitely not happy, such as now, he is going back to the unit to set up the examination room. \n\nTaking the subway, he was relieved to have a seat. As soon as he sat down, he began to think about how to kill this half-hour of boring time. Opening his mobile phone, casually browsing social software, browsing those messages that he forgot as soon as he saw them, until he felt someone poking his shoulder. Turning his head, he saw a girl of the same age sitting next to him. She smiled awkwardly, and then opened her mouth: \n\n\"Excuse me, do you have a power bank? I forgot to bring it when I went out, and now my mobile phone is out of power...\" \n\nHe was stunned at first, then nodded and took out the power bank from his bag. \n\n\"...Yes, yes.\" \n\nLi Xin seemed a little reserved, and he always treated strangers like this. Instead, the girl kept chatting with him, which made Li Xin difficult to adapt for a while, but in addition to browsing his phone, he finally had something to do. As it turned out, Li Xin and she got along well - from hometown to habits, from life experience to hate and like, like old friends reunited, he had to admit that this was a magical feeling. But happy times are always short, the flashing lights on the station sign and the bilingual voice broadcast foreshadowed the end of the two people's wonderful encounter. \n\n\"What a coincidence? You also get off at Fuxing Station?\"\n\nLi Xin rarely took the initiative to bring up the topic, and the girl still smiled, \n\n\"Yes, it's really a coincidence.\"\n\nAfter the subway arrived at the station, Li Xin suddenly remembered the urgency of time. After all, there was still a distance from the subway station to the unit, and he didn't want to cause unnecessary trouble because of being late. After taking the power bank returned by the girl, Li Xin smiled politely at each other and hurried to the exit."

The preparation for each class, the summary of this month and the correction of homework made him feel that his waist had aged more than ten years. Looking up at the ceiling, the white light was a bit dazzling. Closing his eyes, it seemed that work would be thrown out of his mind. He was already thinking about what to eat for dinner...\n\nThere were bursts of footsteps in the quiet corridor during class time. In the past, Li Xin knew who was coming just by listening to the sound, but this time the footsteps were different from the past. It walked and stopped, without any rules, and there was a little familiarity or even a little familiarity in the strangeness. The footsteps were getting closer and closer, which aroused Li Xin's curiosity. When the footsteps stopped at the door of the office, he deliberately saw the owner of the footsteps with his peripheral vision and understood why it sounded strange and familiar. \n\nThe dean of teaching and a newcomer stood in - no wonder there were such footsteps. It turned out that they were two people who were familiar with each other. It seems that the recruitment some time ago has already paid off. The corners of Li Xin's mouth raised slightly, and he knew that his ears were still very sharp. \n\n\"Well, let me introduce you to the new teacher Liao.\"\n\nWith a professional smile, the director finished speaking slowly, and teacher Liao also waved his hand and nodded to these future colleagues. The director looked around again and picked Li Xin out from the \"busy\" figures. \n\n\"Well... Mr.Li, you should not have classes later, right? How about taking teacher Liao around the campus?\"\n\nLi Xin subconsciously wanted to refuse, but when he turned his head to look at the two figures and met her eyes, the scene on the subway that day emerged in his mind, and he immediately understood where the extra familiarity came from. Li Xin frowned slightly, wanting to see more clearly and confirm more, but his mouth had agreed before thinking. \n\nThe two walked one after the other until they reached the corridor on the fourth floor of Building 3. Li Xin made up her mind, stopped, turned around, and said, \n\n\"By the way, you were the one that day...\" \n\nAs if by telepathy, the same words came out of her mouth. After hearing each other's voice, the two stopped talking at the same time, their lips half-opened, looking at each other in a daze, or looking at each other, as if they had not expected everything to happen so cleverly. Liao Cuiying reacted faster. While Li Xin was still stunned, she tilted her head slightly and smiled, \n\n\"Destiny, isn't it magical?\""

Today was the first time that the five-star red flag was raised in Outer Mongolia. The duty of Huo Anhua and his comrades was to ensure that this solemn ceremony would not be disrupted by those radical elements. \nDozens of military vehicles surrounded the square. Huo Anhua sat in the military tent next to the checkpoint, looking at the Sukhbaatar statue in the distance with some pride. \"Let me tell you, do you know why the higher-ups chose me? I am a member of the Huo family. Huo Qubing knows that he sealed the wolf and lived in Xu!\" Huo Anhua kept bragging about his life experience, regardless of the fact that his comrades next to him had already fallen asleep. \nThe first ray of sunlight in the morning hit the sitting statue of Genghis Khan. The command post received an order to strengthen the alert through the intercom. Huo Anhua picked up the helmet from the table, checked his equipment, and walked out of the tent. The streets were empty, with only a few Mongolians. The expressions on their faces were complicated, with anger, but more fear. \nHuo Anhua yawned. The post he was in charge of was not the main entrance to the square, so he didn't need to worry too much. He stared at the Mongolians, and the unconscious pride in his heart surged up again. \nA truck drove over in the distance. Huo Anhua perked up. He stopped the car and asked the driver to show his ID in poor Mongolian according to the regulations in the manual. \nIn the distance, the flag-raising ceremony began. The March of the Volunteers resounded throughout Ulaanbaatar. Huo Anhua hummed the national anthem while watching the Mongolian driver explaining something to him in a gibberish. Huo Anhua was a little impatient. He gestured to the driver to leave. \nThe national anthem reached its climax, but the driver still didn't move the truck. Huo Anhua seemed to notice something. He raised his gun and asked the driver to get off the car immediately in Mongolian. The driver was still speaking in incomprehensible Mongolian. Just when Huo Anhua put his finger on the trigger, the truck crashed straight into the square. He hurriedly tried to stop it, but was knocked aside. Before he could stand up, a ball of flames burst out from the truck, and the shock wave from the explosion threw him dozens of meters away. Then there was a loud bang, and debris and body parts fell like blood rain. \nAfter the national anthem was played, Huo Anhua saw the red flag rising slowly from the flames to the top at the last moment before he lost consciousness."

Why is no one replying? BYD, you are pretending to be a master by not talking, right? ! Thinking of this, Long Xia started to type on the keyboard again...\nKnock knock... Someone suddenly knocked on the door. \n\"Oh my gosh!\" Long Xia was startled: \"Didn't I say that the takeaway can be left at the door?!\" He stood up and walked to the door...\n\"BYD deserves a complaint!\" Long Xia cursed while opening the door. Suddenly, a black bag-like thing covered his head, and at the same time, his legs felt painful and he fell to the ground. Long Xia screamed in fear. He tried to beg for mercy or explain something, but the darkness made him unable to distinguish east, west, south, and north, and the strong fear made him unable to speak clearly. \n\"Woo? Woo?!\"\n\"I told you not to scream!\"\nThe leader growled and rushed at the black bag that kept moving. \nAfter a muffled sound, the black bag fell down and stopped moving. \n\"Quick! Be quick\"\nAfter a while... everything became quiet as usual, only the TV that was not turned off was still broadcasting: \"...We request you to cooperate...\""

In the park, no one had ever come back alive after escaping. \nHe got up from the bed, walked to the window sealed with iron bars, and sighed. The night in Myanmar was humid, and the air was full of the smell of gunpowder and alcohol. Every night, he could hear screams, and he had long been accustomed to it. Sometimes, he and his roommates bet that there would be a few fewer colleagues tomorrow, or more. But tonight was unusually quiet. \nLi Kai sat back on the bed. The silence of the park usually means trouble. He stared at the ceiling, and scenes in China emerged in his mind. He once thought that after China unified Taiwan, the country would rescue them, the people trapped in the electronic fraud park. But the failure of the unification war completely shattered his hopes. He did not become the lucky man, but more big piglets came to the park. \nHe closed his eyes and was just silent. Suddenly, the door was pushed open. He instinctively curled up, ready to meet the guards' clubs, but the imagined beating did not happen. \n\"Li Kai, wake up! Those guards, those bosses are all gone!\" His roommate stood in front of him, but Li Kai's eyes were filled with confusion and fear. His heart tightened, worrying that this was just a new trick of the park. But soon, he realized that he was wrong. \nThey walked out of the dormitory, and the doors of the dormitory building were all open. The other \"piglets\" walked out of the room carefully, with numbness and fear written on their faces. His roommate pulled him through the crowd and headed straight for the dormitory building gate, and more people followed. The door was soon crowded with people. The square, which was originally heavily guarded, was now empty. Li Kai could no longer resist his curiosity. He ran forward excitedly, but bumped into a guard who was about to leave. He stood there like a petrified person, and could only watch the guard raise the rifle in his hand, and then closed his eyes in despair. \nThe gun went off. He opened his eyes and the guard had fallen in a pool of blood. Then, there was the roar of propellers overhead. Li Kai looked up in surprise. Dozens of helicopters were hovering over the park, and several black shadows were sliding down from the ropes. He didn't see their faces clearly, but he could hear the familiar Chinese:"

 china.1534.d: "Today is the 36th day that Lin Zhong has been stationed in Osaka. He Jia crossed out the last number on the calendar, and his whole body felt like it was filled with lead, weighed down by the marching backpack. Cold sweat oozed from both hands. \nNightmare, nightmare is always there. The scene ten days ago was still spinning in his mind. He and his comrades were patrolling the ruined urban area of ​​Osaka. The road was empty, with only crows perched on the broken streets. Suddenly, a cold shot hit his teammate. Lin Zhong yelled at his comrades to hide, and he quickly found a cover and hid next to a scrapped Toyota car. Through the car window, he looked at the dilapidated buildings around him. \nAnother gunshot, and another teammate fell. This was the first time Lin Zhong felt fear. This feeling has never been so strong since landing in Japan. He took a deep breath and raised his gun again. At that moment, he saw a flash of white light in front of the window of the four-story building opposite. \n\"There!\" He yelled and fired a burst of bullets at the light. Comrades also opened fire, and the sound of gunfire exploded like thunder. The crows on the road flew up, leaving only silence. Lin Zhong signaled his teammates to follow, and several people quickly advanced towards the building. \n They went upstairs and came to the light. There lay a woman, gasping for breath, and the wound on her waist was oozing blood. Lin Zhong stepped forward quickly and kicked the rifle out of her hand. Just as he was about to detain her, a bullet pierced her head. \n Lin Zhong turned his head in shock, and a wisp of smoke came out of the muzzle of the machine gunner Li Yu. The shoji door suddenly opened, and Li Yu adjusted the muzzle and kept firing. The sound of gunfire roared in the building until the last bullet was fired, the door was broken into pieces, and there was only a blood mist in front of him. \n The blood mist gradually dissipated, and Lin Zhong finally saw the scene behind the door clearly. \n A boy, a girl, and an old man."

Li Yu patted his shoulder, turned around, picked up the flamethrower, aimed at the corpse on the tatami and pulled the trigger.\nLin Zhong did not look back. There was a scorching air wave behind him.\nAfter returning to the base, Lin Zhong's dream always had several arms struggling in the flames. Whenever he walked forward, the woman on the ground would suddenly raise her head, and Lin Zhong took a closer look. The face was the face of his lover.\n\"Boss, it's your turn to talk to your family.\"\nLin Zhong struggled to get up and walked to the family phone area. Picking up the phone, his wife's familiar and gentle voice came.\n\"Do you know how difficult it is to make an appointment for this call, do you know how worried I am about you? \"The crying voice on the other side made Lin Zhong feel a warmth he had never felt before.\nThe two chatted slowly.\n\"Let my son come and talk to Daddy. He hasn't seen you for a long time.\" Lin Zhong's heart tightened, and his son's chubby little face appeared in front of him, and he couldn't help but smile.\nThe other end of the phone suddenly became noisy, and then a childish voice came\n\"Hello...\"\nLin Zhong's eyes suddenly became wet, and the smoke of the battlefield disappeared in his mind, leaving only the picture of his wife holding his son.\n\"Hello, it's Dad.\"\n\"Dad.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Dad?\"\n\"Here.\"\n\"How many people did you kill in Japan?\""

The vinyl record player next to them was playing \"Red Sun\" by Hacken Lee.\n\"Even if fate is tortuous and bizarre.\"\nXu Fu thought of those years when he and Mariko sang together. He sang \"Red Sun\" and Mariko sang \"That's important\". Because of the same melody, the two could sing like this all night when they were young. At that time, Xu Fu was still a university professor, and Mariko was an external Japanese teacher hired by the school. The two did nothing but sing. He laughed softly, and Mariko saw her husband's smile and laughed too.\n\"Even if fate threatens you that life is boring. ”\nMariko picked up the knife on the table, gently cut off a piece of cake, and then gently placed it in front of Xu Fu. The sound of gunfire outside the window never stopped. Xu Fu stared at his elderly wife in front of him, then lowered his head to look at the cake in front of him. When did the idea of ​​suicide come up? Was it the day when his son was beaten to death in Japan? Was it the day when he and his wife were expelled from the community by their compatriots? Or was it the day when his wife brought him to Japan and slept on the streets of Yokohama?\n\"Don't cry, it's sad.\"\nBefore the outbreak of the war, in the era when the Cold War in East Asia had not yet begun, intermarriage between China and Japan was not uncommon, and people usually gave them the most sincere blessings. Regardless of ideology, people still believed in love more. But the war changed everything, because the war never changed.\nXu Fu picked up the fork and put the cake into his mouth. The aroma of cream burst out in his mouth instantly. Mariko's cooking skills were still so excellent. He raised his head with satisfaction. Mariko was looking at him with a smile, gently wiping the cream from the corner of her mouth.\n\"It should not be abandoned. \"\nWhat a delicious cake! Who would have thought that there was a layer of arsenic inside. Xu Fu held his wife's lifeless hand, and they slowly lay down on the tatami.

 PRC_left_nationalism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_ideology_left_nationalism\n\n\n\n\n\n§YXi Jinping Thought§!, as defined by the CPC's chief theorist Wang Huning, is not a prediction about the socialist future, but more like a summary of the experience of the past forty years of Reform and Opening up. It emphasizes that an all-encompassing ruling party, that is, the CPC, shall lead all aspects of society, and the Party's strict promotion mechanism and uninterrupted anti-corruption campaigns will ensure the ideological purity of the vanguard. Furthermore, in order to bridge the ideological divide within the country, the thought adopts the slogans of "Common prosperity", "Chinese Dream", and "National Rejuvenation", which respond to the rising national pride and the demand for social justice in China. As Xi's position becomes increasingly stable, the Xi Jinping Thought will continue to guide China in the foreseeable future."

 PRC_totalism_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_PRC_ideology_totalism\n\n\n\n\n\nIn his allegorical political horror novel 1984, George Orwell fictionalized 'Oceania,' where everything its citizens say and do, and every aspect of their lives, is controlled by a 'Telescreen,' and where the government extinguishes any possible discontent. Today, it seems that such a fable has become a reality in China in the form of §YDigital Leninism§!. China's leadership is highly focused on AI, not only because it represents the pinnacle of 21st-century technology, but also because it aligns perfectly with the CPC's goals of implementing comprehensive surveillance, control, guidance, and censorship through digital tools. AI serves as the ideal instrument to assist the CPC in establishing a powerful digital totalitarian regime, with its capabilities continually expanding. This ensures that the population remains perpetually confined within a 'technological cage'."

 #LEADER DESC
 PRC_XI_JINPING_DESC: "Born in 1953, Xi Jinping was once part of the \"princelings\" of the CPC. However, during the Cultural Revolution, Xi Zhongxun, his father, fell victim to the purges commonly conducted against revolutionary veterans of that era. As a result, Xi was deprived of the privileged life and, like many young people of that time, was exiled to a dilapidated village near Yan'an. Some argue that it was precisely this decade that taught Xi the prudence and forbearance necessary for statesmanship, and that the future general secretary grew up in the cave dwellings of the Loess Plateau.\n\nAfter his father's rehabilitation, Xi, who completed his studies at Tsinghua University, did not choose to stay in Beijing to pursue a political career. After a brief stint in the Ministry of Defense, Xi began his career in a low-level position of Hebei Province and moved through a number of provinces, including Fujian and Zhejiang, where he gained a wealth of work experience and a reputation for humility. It was only when he was chosen by party elders as an acceptable successor to Hu Jintao that Xi truly came into his own era.\n\nIn the past decade, Deng Xiaoping's plan for peaceful rise has gradually been forgotten. Through a massive anti-corruption campaign and an ambitious national renaissance program, Xi has established himself as the undisputed leader of 21st-century China, neither a revolutionary like Mao Zedong nor a technocrat like Jiang Zemin or Hu Jintao. Xi carefully balances the various factions within the party and different social groups, and knows how to leverage the loyalty and reverence of the party and the people to achieve his goals."
