 greece.1.t: "The State Of Greece"
 greece.1.d: "The birthplace of democracy, the father of Europe, the Second Rome. Greece goes by many nicknames, yet its legacy is most intriguing. Exploited by the Persians, conquered by the Romans, and enslaved by the Turks, the Greeks suffered under the boot of many regimes. Yet, the Greeks always managed to unite and rise from the ashes of the old, from Alexander the Great to Eleftheros Venizelos. Two hundred years have nearly passed since the Greek folks began their struggle for independence against the Ottoman Empire and the formation of the Hellenic Republic, yet, Greece is a shadow of its former self. Plagued by the 2008-2014 Economic Crisis, the economy is still in shambles. Greek politics are still haunted by the ghost of the neo-nazi organization Golden Dawn, and with the Turks constantly exasperating us with their repeated violations of both Greek and Cypriot maritime boundaries, including the military trainings they constantly vaunt about, the Greeks have a lot to deal with. Perhaps, the Greek people can have a fresh new start, with the 2020 Presidential Elections coming round the clock. Should the incumbent PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis repair the fragile condition of Greece, or is Greece going to lead itself to its grave? That is up to you, and only you."
 greece.1.a: "Onwards!"
