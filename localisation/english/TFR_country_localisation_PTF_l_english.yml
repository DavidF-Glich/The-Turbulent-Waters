 PTF_tragedy_of_rousseau_idea_desc: "In 2017, Patriot Front was a discord server that split from Vanguard America. No one, not even Thomas Rousseau himself, could have predicted what was to come. He is living a history that feels almost biblical, unfolding right before his eyes, and it scares him profoundly. A young man barely old enough to drink, over a thousand miles away from home, and betrayed by many of his comrades, he is in an unimaginable situation. What started as a discord server has now grown into a significant political and military force in the Northeast of America. Not many who were there at the beginning are still here, and even fewer knew about the organization's existence two years ago. He can't even recognize the faces he sees anymore, and some don't recognize him. He is merely a figurehead in a revolution that is crying out for a leader. He has no military or political experience, those who do recognize him question his position and are often reluctant to answer to his authority. His views and goals are blurred, and it seems that his creation has forgotten him. His fate is anyone's guess."

 PTF_economic_instability_idea: "Economic Instability"
 PTF_economic_instability_idea_desc: "Ever since the takeover of Connecticut, we have faced a severe issue that has hampered our ability to break out of the region: economic instability. Already, global financial institutions, banks, and corporate assets have unsurprisingly left the state following our liberation, with the greedy capitalists terrified at the emergence of a movement willing to fight them where it matters most. Like parasites, they have leeched off us for a century, and have now taken most of our economy with them. This has spurred a number of problems, weakening our industrial base and production efficiency. It is now the duty of every patriot to rebuild America from the ground up, defending our labor and reviving the heart of the nation's economy."

Mass media manipulation, the indoctrination of America's children, and the societal decay that has rendered Americans complacent with their own repression has fully consumed the once proud nation. Even as we, the crusaders for a new America, descend to reclaim it from the parasites, we will still be met with the hurdle that is leftist infiltration in the brains of hundreds of millions of Americans. If we are to succeed in our great mission, we must cure America, and teach the people about what the cosmopolitans in Washington have been doing to them. Only then, can America be reborn."

Many were active before the war, and now that the conflict has arisen, more and more are being formed by the day for various causes across the country.\n\nOur organization must make good use of this historical ideal. By forming armed groups composed mostly of volunteers from the local populace, we will be able to raise more fighting-capable men to ensure our triumph in the battle for America's fate.

#Events 
 ptf.1.t: "New England Reclaimed" #Needs GFX
 ptf.1.d: "When Thomas Rousseau had established the Patriot Front in late 2017 as a mere teenager, he had always dreamed of leading victorious armies to expel the globalists from America, state by state. But he had never imagined that this process would begin in New England of all places. In a way, it was poetic. Just as Washington's revolution had erupted in New England, so had Rousseau's.\n\nAfter months of brutal warfare against various antifascist and libertarian militias, state governments, police forces, and federal elements, the armies of Patriot Front have finally \"reclaimed\" the northeastern US and New England, seizing control of a significant portion of America's economic and population centers in the process, including New York and Boston. With the northeast firmly under the control of Patriot Front, Rousseau can now finally focus on building up his military strength, crushing loyalist insurgents in regions under Patriot Front's control, and continuing to strengthen his standing in the organization itself.\n\nTo the south in Pennsylvania and New Jersey lies significant federalist forces under the command of Biden's D.C. based \"Union of America\" government. Forces that make up the last significant barrier between Rousseau's own armies in the north, and the capital itself. If the Patriot Front can manage to crush those forces and seize the capital, little will stand in the way of Rousseau's troops gaining control of Appalachia and nearly all the lands to the east. For now, Rousseau will have to bide his time, but the path to victory is becoming ever clearer for the Patriot Front."
 ptf.1.a: "Prepare for the March South"

 ptf.2.t: "Traitors in Black"
 ptf.2.d: "Traitors in our midst! Our headquarters just went up in flames after a litany of bombs were detonated within the building. Heroic firefighters and police immediately cordoned off the scene and began extinguishing the blaze. While their heroism was great, they were unable to save the dozen front members who remained in the building. Tragically, Sir Thomas Rousseau America's loyal comrade, and friend had died in this act of terror.\n\nThe perpetrators of this heinous act have taken to social media and unknown radio broadcasters to advertise the cause of Nationalist Social Club, claiming that our government had sold out to the globalists and other "federal entities", and was planning on rounding up true believers to ship them to their doom in hostile territory. Their scandalous allegations include that Rousseau himself was bribed successfully by the United Nations and that he has since fled the country to a luxury estate in Europe.\n\nThese men have armed, and have taken over vast swathes of our territory and proclaiming loyalty to Chris Hood. Among their number are various men whom Rousseau and his comrades thought of as allies, namely Erick Striker and Warren Balogh. Many members of the NJP are now in the enemy camp as well.\n\nThe darkest days are here. We can only hope our cause emerges from this storm alive."
 ptf.2.a: "Traitors rot in the ninth circle."

 ptf.3.t: "The Patriot Front Triumphant"
 ptf.3.d: ""
 ptf.3.a: "America Has Been Reclaimed!"

 ptf.4.t: "Collapse of the Green Mountain Anarchist Collective"
 ptf.4.d: "As Vermont continues to burn, our forces celebrate; a great degenerative evil has been crushed under the boot heels of our glorious patriots.\n\nThe most cumulative effort to spread the ways of wasteful pleasure to date, the GMAC, currently lies in a crumpled heap at our feet. With our forces having completely routed and crushed these anarchists, we have seen it fit to enact quite the brutal reprisal against those who have foolishly clamored to the principles of a perfidious lack of self-control. Beset upon by our soldiers, captured militants endure harsh beatings for the slightest sign of disobedience, in a redemptive effort to remove them of their childlike rebellious nature. Their equally reprehensible leaders have been subjected to swift executions, often met with taunts and humiliation before the crack of a hangman's noose became the last thing they'd hear.\n\nTheir lower ranks, generally consisting of anarchist degenerates and other undesirable heathens, have met similar fates to their leadership. Many have been executed in equally orderly fashions, led to the gallows as they realize that their attempts to destroy America and American culture were all for naught. Those who have not been executed have been thrown into trucks and transported to secure locations, where they will undoubtedly be put to work for what can be considered a very productive future. They will learn what it's like to be a hard-working American - we cannot think of a more fitting punishment than to have them fuel our war effort in the long-run. Perhaps, if ever released, they'll have changed their tune regarding these foolish ideals fought for in their past that will never come to fruition.\n\nMany civilians in their territory, as expected, are content to see the anarchists gone - however, not all of them are so inclined. It appears that, unfortunately, more Americans have fallen to their ideals than we originally anticipated. As we begin to restore order and a sense of patriotic duty to their territories, we must ensure that this mindset is quickly removed. Forcefully, if need be."
 ptf.4.a: "A fitting end for their attempts to destroy our country."

 ptf.5.t: "Second Boston Massacre"
 ptf.5.d: "It all began with a snowball.\n\nGathering in the Boston common, numerous Neoliberal and Socialist groups gathered to protest our recent takeover of the city. Highlighting some of our supposed "crimes" across the city and region, protestors bearing signs of criminal relatives that we have detained demand an end to Martial law and the restoration of full Civil Rights. Starting small, this protest was watched closely by our forces.\n\nAfter reports among informants trickled in alleging that the protestors planned to march on city hall, the newly installed Police chief ordered that the protestors disperse by hours end, promising swift retribution if his directive was not obeyed. After brief deliberations, the Protest leaders resolved by vote to continue with their course of action. They sealed their fate.\n\nOne protester apparently threw a snowball, full of ice and rock fragments at our soldiers, who stood calm and ordered the protestors to disperse, re-iterating the Police chief's orders. This seemed to only incense the protestors, who began pelting some of our men with rocks, sticks and other debris. Following an incredibly loud bang, one soldier was hit particularly hard by a heavy object. Explaining that he thought he had been shot, he opened fire into the air, his compatriots doing likewise. Some protestors then allegedly surged forwards, eliciting a general firing into the crowd.\n\nNow, ten people lie dead, sixty-seven hospitalized, and hundreds with minor or grievous injury from the ensuing stampede. Meanwhile, besides the one injured before the firing, who was not in fact shot (we have yet to disclose this to the general public), only one man sustained a minor broken arm from being briefly knocked to the ground during the protestors retreat. While being an optical disaster, the chaos gave us a good chance to round up the protest leaders, who are now being made productive to the cause of American renewal elsewhere."

La Meute is the former. Recognizing that our struggles are not all that dissimilar, they have sent some fighters in an effort to gain combat experience. While their language might sound silly, we can take all the help we can get.\n\n Unfortunately, Canada has taken notice of this and has tightened border patrol.

 ptf.12.d: "A clock strikes midnight in the city that never sleeps. A young man is slumbering over a keyboard, reaching for his coffee and adderall, asking himself if his 100k debt in student loans was worth it. His boss across the aisle is staring out his window. Nervous to go to the home he pays and works for. He doesn't want to hear his wife scream about how the dog took a shit in the new carpet she bought at homegoods with her coupons. He is scared to see what his daughter will be wearing on her night out. Terrified to see his son follow in the same footsteps.\n\nIs all of this normal? Men slumbered and lost in the labyrinth of corporate America, chained to their desks, working towards what are essentially meaningless numbers in the most literal sense. Are we working to live or living to work?\n\nIn the pursuit of the American Dream, countless hours are spent tethered to screens and report sheets, living off cups of coffee, and chasing elusive deadlines. As the lines between our personal and professional lives blur, the mantra "time is money" becomes an all-encompassing truth. We find ourselves caught, entrapped in a cycle of corporate servitude. How did we land ourselves in this predicament? The answer lies in the marriage of consumerism and corporatism. The corporate entities have become adept at perpetuating a myth; that the good life is a product of tireless toil and constant consumption. But at what cost? Health, family, peace of mind - aren't these the real measures of a life well-lived?"

We're immersed in a relentless symphony of advertisements and sales pitches, urging us to acquire more, to consume more. A quiet tyranny in this cycle of endless acquisition–a cycle that strips away our core values and replaces them with a voracious hunger for the latest. The very essence of the natural primal instinct of spirit–individualism, self-reliance, and the pursuit of genuine happiness– is in danger of being buried under a mountain of the unnecessary and superfluous.\n\nThis fight is not about rejecting prosperity or a call for minimalism, but about reclaiming our independence from corporate entities that stoke the fires of endless desire. It's about freedom."

 ptf.17.d: "Those who knew of the Patriot Front well enough, be they civilians or direct members of the organization itself, were well aware of the fact that internal dissent was something of a taboo topic within the ranks. A unified rank-and-file was key to achieving victory in a time of national struggle, and those who sought to disrupt that unity were, to put it lightly, extremely scrutinized. While certain disagreements were bound to occur, no internal group had been more disruptive than the Strasserites, headed by formerly influential NSM member Matthew Heimbach. Heimbach, of course, was nothing more than some petty communist infiltrator to our organization - spreading his perfidious Bolshevik leanings to those more gullible members who would listen. Until today.\n\nPurportedly a directive from Rousseau himself, the prime leadership of Heimbach's strasserite-esque clique were suddenly apprehended this morning, arrested and dragged from where they stood before they could react into interrogation rooms, where they were subject to several hours of questioning before being placed on trial for their treacherous behavior. With Rousseau himself attending the trial, as well as a variety of influential figures and lower-ranking members, Heimbach and his cronies sun deeper into their seats as their crimes were read out before them, of which included: encouraging disunity among the ranks, undermining Front efforts, and spreading communistic beliefs, all of which amounted to nothing short of treason.\n\nThe tribunal reached a verdict soon afterwards - guilty on all counts, and henceforth sentenced to death by firing squad. As such, the caucus leadership were promptly dragged outside, a hurl of insults thrown at them as they were led to the wall. Heimbach cowardly pleaded for forgiveness as terms such as "cousin-fucker" and "fat rat bastard" were hurled his direction by many attending members, up until the crack of rifle fire put an end to his pathetic wailing.\n\nWith their leadership dead, the average member of Heimbach's caucus have fallen in line once more, likely fearful of being implicated themselves and meeting the fate of their leaders. Rest assured, they will not be stepping out of line again."

Some argue for a total eradication of these icons of avarice, advocating for their replacement with symbols exuding vitality, virtue, and the spirit of a reformed America. Conversely, others propose we preserve some of these landmarks, acknowledging their historical role in fortifying America's position as a leading economic titan.\n\nHowever diverse these views are, a common thread binds them together - an adamant resolution that these monuments should not revert to their former corrupt state. If preservation wins the day, we pledge to implement rigorous safeguards to thwart the resurgence of the malpractices of the past. Once we've reclaimed America in its entirety, we are adamant that such exploitation will never blight our nation again."

They hold that the populace, lulled into a state of docile compliance, can no longer be entrusted with America. Yet, even amidst these profound beliefs, they assert that the old republic's cornerstones can yet provide support in the crucible of the New Republic. They draw from the past to seek a new future.\n\nThe Futurists see America ascending, evolving into a beacon of might and virtue that surpasses its former glory. Fueled by the compelling dream of an America reborn, these visionary architects seek to reinstate the nation's global hegemony, and to orchestrate the arrival of a new golden age.

Our current capital, Boston, has much symbolic value, being the first major city the British were expelled from during the original revolution, and the first major city our organization captured during the second revolution. It is also deep within our territory, and is not at great risk of being overrun or surrounded by an enemy offensive.\n\nOn the other hand, New York City is by far the largest city we control, and is also globally known as the world's most powerful and important city. Making New York our seat of power would show the world that we are not just some unorganized militant group, but the rightful contenders for being the successors of the old American government. Many within our officer core have also pointed out that New York City is much larger than Boston, and very easily defendable due to the unending maze of massive skyscrapers making up the city.

The effort was immense, as essentially the entire city was full of degenerate symbolism and structures, but after much effort, the organization's demolition teams finally reached Times Square.\n\nFirst, the buildings around the Square were occupied and cleared of snipers, as they had been encountered multiple times even after the enemy had already surrendered in New York City, treacherously attempting to continue their war of annihilation against the American people, in service to their wicked globalist masters. Thomas Rousseau himself was present to make a speech at Times Square before its destruction, accusing the place of representing soulless consumerism on behalf of a rootless cosmopolitan elite who had for decades poisoned and destroyed American culture, replacing it with a degenerate and sterile husk. After his speech concluded, the square was cleared and demolished with ample amounts of high explosives, with the event being recorded and broadcasted live for the entire world to see."

They refer to their ideology as National Spartanism, advocating for a militaristic warrior society to prevent America from succumbing to weakness and subservience to corrupt elites.\n\nThroughout our campaign, Will2Rise and the Spartanists have proven themselves to be an exceptionally effective fighting force, displaying unwavering dedication to the cause.

Although the supply of technical-advisors to Patriot Front to teach units on the operation of military equipment was not particularly surprising to us, the supply of combat volunteers was a positive surprise to us. Some within our organization have speculated that Belarus is sending combat units to America as a method of gaining them combat experience in preparation for future conflict in Europe.

Many of the volunteers have explicitly asked to be placed under his command.\n\nThe equipment and weapons of the Chetnik fighters is not very high tech or advanced - mostly AK47s and old Warsaw Pact and Yugoslav leftolders, but the volunteers have made up for their lack of advanced or high quality equipment with loyalty and fierce dedication to our cause. Many of these Chetniks also have recent combat experience from the Donbas, and some of them even have experience from the Bosnian and Yugoslav Wars, with rumors floating around our organization that several of the volunteers were former members of Arkan's Tigers and other infamous Serbian nationalist militant groups. Their support is greatly appreciated and will surely help us defeat the corrupt tyrants that have occupied our nation for so long."

 ptf.29.d: "Most of the time, when Patriot Front has received an offer of support or volunteers, the organization has graciously accepted it. Everybody within the front knows that the organization will need all the national and international support it can get to succeed in its revolutionary aspirations - after all the American Revolution would have likely failed without the support of the French and Prussian Kingdoms. However, for the first time in a while, Patriot Front has received an offer of support that many in the organization would rather refuse. Apparently, the Cosa Nostra, also known as the American Mafia, had offered to support the Patriot Front, with a member serving as the intermediary. They offered that the Costra Nostra would support the Patriot Front in any capacity necessary for the organization to achieve victory in the civil war under a few 'simple' conditions. The two major conditions are they are given free range in many of their activities, and that Patriot Front would offer a pardon to every Cosa Nostra associate and whomever else requires it.\n\nThe offer is indeed appealing to many members of Patriot Front, as they can help pacify local gangs and criminal organizations that have taken advantage of the situation. The Costra Nostra still has a relatively large network of associates and corrupt officials in somewhat influential positions and connections globally.\n\nSome have also pointed out that allowing known members of the Mob into our ranks could harm the legitimacy of the organization both at home and worldwide and would likely be hard to justify to the public. Furthermore Fascist Italy under Mussolini successfully destroyed the Mafia and we have the opportunity to do it here right now considering how we have most of their leadership in custody\n\nUltimately, it is obvious to all those involved that such an important decision as this one can only be made by the leader himself."

The already overcrowded and under-resourced prison is now the scene of chaos and violence, with inmates seizing control of several cellblocks and battling against correctional officers. The situation inside the prison is said to have reached a boiling point when a group of inmates, emboldened by the turmoil outside the prison walls, staged an uprising. The rioting soon spread throughout the facility, with fires being set, staff being taken hostage, and inmates battling one another in a bid for control. Authorities have struggled to contain the unrest, with the Continental Army being called in to assist the beleaguered correctional staff. Despite their best efforts, the situation remains volatile, and the full extent of the damage and casualties is still unknown.\n\nThe riot at Rikers Island has been exacerbated by the Second American Civil War, which has strained the nation's infrastructure and resources. The ongoing conflict has made it difficult for authorities to maintain order in the prison, as they are simultaneously tasked with combatting armed insurgents and maintaining public safety in New York City. The chaos at Rikers Island is a reflection of the wider unrest gripping the United States. As the country continues to be torn apart by deep-seated political and social divisions, the situation in its prisons and detention facilities serves as a microcosm of the disorder that has enveloped the nation.\n\nAs authorities work to restore order at Rikers Island, questions are being raised about the future of the prison and the country's criminal justice system as a whole. The Second American Civil War continues to leave a trail of destruction in its wake, with no end in sight to the chaos and conflict.."

Those Patriots just like many other Americans in the twilight of the Old Republic had found their way here into our movement.\n\nThe two emerging forces within the Right currently are Populism and Reactionist. The Populist platform advocates for government servitude to the people and interests of those below rather than elitism of the above. Furthermore they argue corruption and national nihilism were the driving force behind the decline of the previous regime. Believing that a revolutionary vanguard of the people shall be the driving force of the government. While the Reactionary platform, believing that America's decline started at the outbreak of the first civil war. Claiming that cultural decline and modernism were the root cause of all the problems America was facing. Not only advocating for bigger government and more centralization, many theorists within the group see the American people as part of the problem with democracy as a whole responsible for the decline.\n\nUltimately the question remains on which force we should sponsor.

Some, in their cowardice, assert that anyone can be an American; others, in their ignorance, describe it as esoteric nonsense. Some believe it's biological, while others insist it's physical. The truth is that no single thing can define what it means to be an American. The journey of becoming an American requires sacrifice, resilience, and dedication to the shared values that make our nation strong. Being an American signifies not merely a birthright but a commitment to the shared principles we hold dear.\n\nDrawing from Teddy Roosevelt's concept of what it means to be an American, we believe that the American spirit is not confined by birthright or physical boundaries. Instead, it is a state of mind, a spiritual journey, a testament to resilience, and a dedication to the shared values that make our nation unique.\n\nMoreover, we uphold the importance of assimilation, as Teddy Roosevelt once championed. This is not about diluting individual cultures into a monotonous blend. Rather, we encourage everyone to bring their unique cultures, stories, and experiences to the American tapestry, all while aligning with the core principles that bind us as a nation. Our aim is to cultivate a shared identity and mutual understanding among all who call America home. We see 'American' as a commitment that transcends birthplace and evolves into a profound sense of belonging and shared destiny."

In every city square, every neighborhood, every home and heart, our party's spirit will thrive and flourish, setting the rhythm of the nation.\n\nWe believe that this relationship, this interweaving of politics and daily life, brings us closer to the people we serve. Our leaders are not distant figures; instead, they stand shoulder to shoulder with every American in the shared endeavor of building a future of promise and prosperity. This is the vision of our initiative, 'The Bull Moose Within Us.'\n\nUnder the guiding hand of the Bull Moose, we are crafting an America that cherishes its past, grapples earnestly with its present, and strides confidently into its future. With each passing day, the Bull Moose spirit shall permeate deeper into the American psyche, a testament to the resilience and tenacity of our people.

The shift in ideology was an inevitable consequence of Thomas Rousseau's decision to further accommodate the radical wing of Patriot Front led by Chris Hood, the former leader of the NSC-131 organization before its merger with Patriot Front. Unfortunately, this necessary ideological shift has had other severe consequences. A treasonous clique of Republican seditionists led by the former Maine governor, Paul LePage, and called the \"New England Republican Movement\", has launched a full scale mutiny against our military government.\n\nA significant portion of our military forces have already defected to this reactionary cause, claiming the Patriot Front are \"socialist, big government tyrants\" who wish to destroy America. While much of the forces that have defected to the rebels are militia, they are still very large in number and control much of the northeastern states we have worked so hard to reclaim. In the end, their motivations for betraying our glorious revolution do not matter, nor should they be considered. They are nothing more than treasonous scum, and they will be treated as such. All their mutiny will serve to achieve is to expose traitors and cowards among our ranks, and allow us to properly exterminate them."

 ptf.89.d: "On one uneventful Boston morning, nothing was out of the usual. The average citizen would read from the national newsletter, distributed by local minutemen after the collapse of internet infrastructure in America. The only major reportings were from the front lines, detailing a grim situation unfolding in the west, as well as internal infiltration by communists and globalists. It was nothing new, though this edition seemed particularly dire. It wasn't a secret that the Front was being subverted by members of the Grand Old Party that had joined up with them to survive against the anarchist degenerates, communists, and federalists that were rampant in New England, though to what extent they had entrenched themselves in the organization was unknown to both the public and those at the very top.\nThat day, there was a relatively important session being held in the Continental Congress, with the main subject being the war effort. It had been called by Paul LePage, former governor of Maine and the figurehead of the Grand Old Party, which has been growing in strength recently due to the many failures undergone during Rousseau's presidency, both on the frontlines and on the homefront. The reason for the emergency session was unclear, though the harsh reality of what was going down in that meeting room would soon be exposed to the entire nation.\nLePage sat down in the chair from which he would have the floor, directly facing the Congress and the throne on which Rousseau sat, decorated in fascist symbolism and traditional Americana. He was wracked with anger and ruin, and he knew that if America was truly going to be saved from the menace that stood before him, he must take action here and now. This would be his Ides of March, and, like Brutus before him, he had already gathered several conspirators, including the Praetorian Guard. He gathered the courage to speak:\n"My fellow Americans, it is with utmost honor and dignity that today, I will stand here a free man, no longer shackled by the rats who claim to be reclaiming America, while in reality they are leaving it in ruin..." Even the mention of the Patriot Front's slogan in such a manner caused sudden outrage not seen before in Congress, as Rousseau sat speechless and confused.\n"For I wish it was 1804, we would have an honorable duel..." His words began to slur, as he reached into his suit. "But I'm afraid you have no honor left in you. Like Hamilton before you, your little runt head will be left splattered on the wall behind you!" He unholstered a Model 29, firing it directly at Rousseau thrice before the man could even react. He was left dead on the spot, his corpse slumped over his throne. The Praetorian Guard on stand-by entered the room, arresting most in the Congress. LePage left his seat, with violent brawls taking place and the Congress was left in shambles. Those within the GOP were either left horrified or gave a standing ovation. As crime scene tape was plastered across the opening hall, and most of the Congress escorted out in handcuffs, LePage couldn't help but feel dignified."

I promise a future where the US will not be corrupted from the outside or the inside, I will provide a future that can give the citizens of America what they want."\nRousseau then looked down at his carefully written speech.\n"I am not a radical, no matter how many times people call me that.

Our efforts to persuade our citizens to fight against the insurgents have been doing great, with some forming local protection battalions to sniff out and annihilate any possible insurgent cells.

The picturesque nature reserves and parks outside of the city were sights to behold as grand oak trees, rolling green hills, and flora of all shapes and kinds dotted every inch of the park. The space also had a few monuments to Bostonians who fought in the Civil War, the First World War, and the Second World War. They were aged pieces of artistic remembrance that drew the man's attention, but he was not here for those. He was here to see a new memorial erected on top of a hill dedicated to the comrades he knew during his recent time in service.\nAfter some time walking and making his way to march up the hill, he finally arrived and stood in awe to gaze upon the memorial to a new generation of American heroes.\nOn top of this hill was a grand new memorial to all the men in Patriot Front who died fighting for the cause, and he was quickly humbled by the now familiar PF grandeur. Long alleys of flowers of all colors, engravings of recent victories, an ornate ever-burning flame made of steel and marble, and towering blocks of stone with lists of names imposed upon the man both power and somber remembrance. In the very center of it all, a statue of a Patriot Front Minutemen stood proud and tall, triumphantly raising an AR-15 in a gesture of proud conquest over all of PF's enemies. He could not describe the feeling he was getting from witnessing the splendor of the whole complex. All the triumph, all the pride, all the gorgeous adulation of their might and achievement; this was the greatness of Patriot Front rendered in physical form. It was wonderful, it was beautiful, it was utterly compelling, but most of all, it was glorious.\nBut out of all the grand works and decorations, he focused on the bottom, right below the statue of the Minuteman.

However, due to the recent stalemates in the border skirmishes against the Patriot Front, experts are unsure about the effectiveness of the Canadian offensive across such a vast region.\nThe international community has been taken aback by Canada's intervention, as the country initially declared non-intervention during the Second American Civil War after they were overwhelmed with refugees.

We will be meeting on a number of issues, most prominently the refugee crisis, but also the flight of treacherous liberal politicians who governed and exploited New England. It is also likely that the Canadians are going to demand something from us in exchange, likely rules of engagement on the American frontlines, extending their greedy hands in the business of America. While this is unsavory for us, as Canadians do not and should not run American politics, it is a necessity, as a two-front war with our northern neighbor could very likely end in disaster.\n\nIf this meeting goes wrong, however, we have called up volunteers to guard our northern border, and we have decided to close the border for the time being, which will be a major point of contention at Kingston. Our most trusted diplomats will be in attendance, and we will entrust them with the future of the Patriot Front. The decision to hold a conference was also influenced by the Canadians raising concerns on humanitarian issues in New England, such as the Red Cross being refused access, as we can take care of our people, and rules of engagement, which are practically irrelevant in the fight against tyranny. We will attempt to get across these points, and that Canada should have little involvement in the decision-making of Americans, but remember to not push our luck, as Canada is poised to strike at any moment should they be provoked."

While we should get the point across that rules of engagement are irrelevant in the grand scheme of our struggle, we should not press against the issue too hard, or else the Canadians will get the wrong impression of our movement if it even matters to them anyway. The Canadians have started by offering a complete list of "suggested" ROEs, and it is clear that they are trying to strongarm us. We've called their bluff, listing out a counter-offer that has not been perceived well by the Canadians. Their rules include stipulations preventing the seizure of property, the detaining of civilians, and "minimum force necessary" in combat situations. We find these preposterous, and that these rules would severely limit our combat ability, as well as give the Canadians a position to continue hampering down on us at the round-table.\n\nThere are also arguments in favor of accepting their deal, saying that if we are to maintain a relationship of trust and dignity, we are to appease the Canadians and codify rules of engagement within our Army, allowing us to champion honor and gain the support of the American people.

Elections are one of the main reasons why America has been consumed by liberal degeneracy and weakened, both externally and internally. If we do not want this to repeat with us, then we must either reject the offer or propose some sort of compromise. President Rousseau is firmly against compromise in this regard, though due to the influence of National Republicans, he is unable to fully rule it out, and it is up to the delegation's personal political agenda to decide it. A compromise consisting of power being transferred to Congress to appease the Canadians has been drafted by the National Republicans, and it is now time to make a decision.

We have concluded that the American people can take care of themselves, and we do not need the rest of the globe to intervene in our humanitarian affairs, simple as that. This has brought great concern to our northern neighbors, who wish to see the Red Cross return to New England. While we wish to maintain our humanitarian relief services, it is an incredibly important point for Canada, and they will likely try and force our hand. Internally, we are divided on this issue, as some believe that we should dig our feet in the sand and refuse to let the globalists infiltrate our great nation.

 ptf.105.d: "With everything out of the way, now comes the most important issue of the Conference that the Canadians have been beating around the bush about for so long: the refugee crisis. Every day, tens of thousands of Americans cross into Canada through New England illegally, mostly along ratlines built by "humanitarian" organizations. This has caused a severe brain drain, a decrease in factory productivity, as well as a significant portion of the manpower pool gone, hurting our movement badly. This has to stop, and likewise, it is surely causing headaches up north with the influx of so many refugees. Despite this, Canada has refused to return these refugees back to their homeland, and has even called out our border policy. This is outrageous, and we must draw a line in the sand, saying "no more" to their provocation. It is either they return the refugees, or we leave this Conference dissatisfied and outraged.

We were unable to agree, or even compromise on anything, and what we did compromise on is likely going to be declared null by either parties in the negotiations. Aerial surveillance reports have indicated a heavy buildup by the Canadian military on the border, and it is likely that they are going to directly intervene in the Second American Civil War, attempting to strike us down with their degenerate politics.

This has come after several decisive victories over the weak and inefficient Canadian military, and the capture of Lower Canada. In Boston, we have come to an agreement that Canada will withdraw from all American affairs, the Maritime Region of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and all of Quebec up to the Saint-Lawrence will be transferred to us and recognized as such, and all stipulations imposed on us at Kingston will be repealed. Despite detesting the terms of the treaty, the Canadians were forced to with the destruction of most of their Army at our hands, and it is sure to take them ages to recover from our might.\n\nNow, the largest question at hands is how we go about integrating these new-found territories. Liberal governors and politicians will be arrested, rounded up, and delivered swift justice. No longer can they hide in their government buildings, repressing and exploiting people who should have been American from the beginning. We will also begin ideological integration, banning the parasitic political parties and stamping out the Anti-American vermin wherever they appear. Infrastructure projects to connect these territories to the rest of New England will also commence, with it being a huge ideological victory not just for us in America, but for us abroad. Yet, this is only the first step to reclaiming America and declaring victory over her adversaries."

The forces have declared their withdrawal from the continental US due to the current logistical and political challenges. The decision to order a tactical withdrawal across the border was deemed necessary. Many experts had predicted this eventuality after Canadian offensives had stalled.\nIn response to the announcement, the Patriot Front - the group opposing the Canadian Forces - stated that they had already anticipated the Canadian retreat, even during the initial stages of the conflict. They claimed to have encircled and destroyed previously retreating Canadian forces while providing videos of prisoners and captured vehicles. However, the actual cost of the Canadian retreat was revealed through photos and videos of numerous dead Patriot Front soldiers and burning vehicles.\nDespite the withdrawal, the conflict continues to escalate, with no end to the hostilities in sight. The number of refugees coming from the region has increased sharply, and experts warn that the most brutal battles are yet to come. With the possibility of an incursion into Canadian territory not yet ruled out."

 ptf.109.d: "Thomas Rousseau's office was littered with books. Engineering manuals, law dictionaries, and other dour textbooks were preeminent, but on the desk at the center, there was only one. The worn spine simply read "Washington". Rousseau leafed through it, pausing occasionally to read a passage or two.\nRousseau thought it all quite fortuitous. The surveyor turned soldier, turned advocate for justice, turned General for the Continental Army, turned President. Every small detail evoked a thousand stories. Here, thought Rousseau, was a founder. He led while others theorized, wrote articles, and bickered away at each other. His martial prowess kept the nation together. America owed itself to him.\nRousseau stood up, and stared out his window. Boston was gloomy, a pale gray obscuring all but a faint white light, which illuminated the nearby brick buildings only so they seemed decrepit and frail, and the skyscrapers as dark and unnatural. No people roamed the streets, and no cars drove beneath. Curfews and rationing had taken their toll. The soldiers that paced below shifted uncomfortably in the damp. Rousseau sighed, and returned\nThe day's mood was redolent of Washington, Rousseau realized. New England was like Valley Forge, a test for future conflicts. The city that shivered behind him was like those hastily constructed little cabins, only unlike the frost creeping upon the soldiers, the issues plaguing the city were more anthropogenic in origin. Washington knew how to deal with that kind of problem, too. The more Rousseau read of Washington, the more he communed with that man's true essence. He and he weren't too dissimilar after all."

 ptf.110.d: "As soon as the men of the Nortex Legion, 2nd Motor-Rifle Division awoke that morning, they were briefed by their commanding officer on Thomas Rousseau's visit to the frontlines, particularly their division. Of course, stunts like this were nothing new, as the Patriot Front wanted all the attention, recognition, and propaganda it could get, though Rousseau visiting a place so close to the brutal forefronts of the Second American Civil War was unheard of. Cameron Kathan Pruitt, who led the Nortex Army Group, currently engaged in high-intensity urban combat in Pennsylvania, had been in contact with Rousseau on the topic. A film crew would also be arriving, as well as the Chief Editor of the Patriot Front's newsletter. As the briefing ended, the arrival of several MRAPs near the entrance of the base saw the minutemen shuffle in line, wanting to appear their best for their Commander-in-Chief.\nThomas Rousseau got out of the vehicle, with a news crew towing behind him, carrying cameras, tripods, iPhones and more. They set up an improvised film studio near the trees before filming. He wore a PASGT helmet with the Patriot Front logo plastered on it, aswell as the standard vesting of your average Legionary. Cameron was there aswell, standing behind the President. The 300 or so militiamen greeted the President with a Roman salute, aswell as the customary "Hail Caesar". They stood in line, with the President speaking:\n"Legionaries, crusaders, and warriors of a new America. You all stand here today, vying for rejuvenation and victory over the globalists who have torn apart our nation, weakened our people, and left our culture in ruin. You, as the army of righteousness and utmost morality, will fight to your last drop of blood to defend your family, your homeland, your honor, and your fatherland. The road to restoring faithfulness in our people is a long one, with the communists, socialists, and liberals using everything in their power to stop us from achieving civilizational prosperity. Yet, we will not be deterred, we will not fall to their deceit, and we will achieve victory!"The sound of gunshots, artillery fire, and the hum of drones were ever present throughout his speech, sometimes getting uncomfortably close to the base. The soldiers delivered another round of salutes, as Rousseau continued:\n"Some of you may not return from your upcoming battles alive. While the loss of every patriot is tragic, there is glory and dignity in death, and those who lay down their lives for the national struggle are martyrs for a new America. I will serve by you today as your President and Commander-in-Chief. For those of you fighting for your families, your nation, your culture, your heritage, your liberty, and your sovereignty, I have nothing but the highest amount of respect for you."

 ptf.112.d: "Great Patriot Front banners hung over the floor of the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, where hundreds of delegates intermingled. A hundred political alliances were born on the first day of the convention, alongside countless personal friendships and rivalries. Famous faces were surrounded by loyal acolytes and spied from afar by skeptics or opponents. Spontaneous speeches, some moving and provocative, others turgid and tautological, could be heard from the ramparts and stages.\n\nOutside the repaired Convention Center, a solemn sight lay upon the City of Boston, as the military occupation is lit alight with sounds of gunfire as the fledging resistance continues to fight on. A once prosperous city of over 600,000 is now a shell of its former self, with only 35 percent of its residents remaining after weeks of fighting.\n\nAlready, many currents have made their positions clear and voices heard amid the cacophony, advocating for their own brands of restoration. Futurists, comprising engineers, chemists, prometheans, and Traditionalists focus on altering the constrictive aspects of the pre-revolutionary American nation, training their ire on bureaucratism, which they worry may become prominent among their erstwhile comrades. Ardent National Socialists too have a presence, attacking the \"Judaizers\" in their midst, alongside championing a litany of racialist reforms.\nThis convention has only just begun.

This much, every member of the Patriot Front can agree.\n\nWhere we differ is in what we wish to do with it. Jacksonians seek only to edit it, amending it to ensure Socialism, Neoliberalism, and postmodernism can never find legal root in our nation, and to take into account modern, cultural, racial, and social issues. Advocates of this position argue that the Constitution is our forefather's greatest heritage, a necessary link to the past with so many others withering away during our nation's cultural and social decline.\n\nOpponents of keeping the Constitution that keeping the document would prove to be an albatross, preventing the necessary exercise of power on behalf of our leaders and preserving a reactionary conservative symbol.

This war for this nation has the capability of ending both our lives and the existence of our movement. Since such a crisis has fallen upon us, it is absolutely necessary and mandatory that we take steps to secure the efficacy and functionality of our leadership. Now is not the time to allow things that would cause totally unnecessary distractions and sap resources from our leadership. Drastic times of crisis, as shown in countless periods of modern history, require drastic measures at the executive level to avert disaster. What we can immediately act on are giving our leadership... "special" powers for the time being.\nAs much it may seem unpopular for a society like the US, we could give the executive temporary absolute power to do what is necessary to lead the nation. These powers will give executive bodies the ability to sidestep multiple bureaucratic institutions, bypass other branches of government, have empowered authority for unilateral decisions or decrees, and restrict the political and social activities of the citizenry. The ability for the executive to obtain these powers will be contingent on if we are still within a wartime crisis which are all within party and non-party bylaws, regulations, and provisions. Restrictions on civil liberties or political activity have been instituted in some way or form multiple times in US history from the Civil War to the World Wars, so this should not seem too foreign to many people.\nHowever, if we deem it necessary, we could give the executive "temporary" absolute power to do what is necessary but this time with very loose restrictions on where such powers end. In a war for survival, who has the time to abide by specific rules and regulations? In this dreaded conflict that can wipe out our very existence, what needs to be done will be done; no questions asked. This "temporary" arrangement will give the executive whatever is needed to execute the war effort with the desired level of efficacy and efficiency. If the citizenry needs to have rights revoked, then so be it; If Congress or the courts need to be sidestepped, then so be it; if every law in the book needs to be suspended or bypassed, then so be it; if all of society needs to be totally subordinate to the will of the executive, then so be it. The leadership must lead! A war can only be won if it has all the tools necessary to reach the end goal of resolving this crisis. Anything else now... means nothing!"

Even reading his notes was something he could barely keep his attention on as his mind kept drifting off thinking about what was to occur within the next few minutes. He was not a man to visibly give off any kind of volatility in his emotions or demeanor. Almost everyone in the party viewed him as a man of cool, calm, and even cold determination and appearance, but underneath, he was not always the same as his public image. He would be going in front of his fellow party members this morning to announce a radical new promise for the war effort. He had been thinking about this for weeks now, but now the moment came to make his grand announcement. Now looking at his watch, he saw that the time was now, and stepped out of the back room onto a stage in a very large conference room. Now putting on a confident smile, it was his time to exude his power as a leader. If there was any doubt left, it needed to be left behind in that back room. The large crowd of PF party members all clapped in unison and awaited with anticipation for his grandiose statement.\n"Patriots! Comrades! And dedicated men of this great party! I come to you today with great news and a window into the future!" Rousseau declared with gusto.\nThe PF party members all clapped and hollered with praise.\n"Our war effort is proceeding forward with great progress. Our forces march ever forward on every front. Our general staff of talented commanders has noted to me that they expect our progress to remain consistent and with great outlook in the foreseeable future. However, we must recognize some key facts of the situation", Rousseau continued as the crowd listened on with keen interest and anticipation.\n"This war will not be won with protracted stalling and overly methodical war planning that will stretch this conflict into many years. Not a chance! To win, we must be swift and strong. To win, we must knock out our enemies with lightning-fast precision. That is why, under my leadership and coordination with our armed forces, we aim for effective and decisive results. That is why today, I bring to you a glimpse of our future. A future, under my stewardship, that will bring the war effort and this conflict to a close within 700 days!"\nThe crowd erupts into a standing ovation mixed with cheers and whistling. The massive outpour of praise and support by the crowd now puts a large ecstatic expression on Rousseau's face. However, even as he smiled and made his promises to the crowd, he knew that he now needed to mobilize everything possible to make this bombastic promise a reality; because if he failed... he knew very well what consequences would mean for him, let alone his position."

The Black vans seemed like a snake as they traveled through the winding roads, out of place and strange amidst the forests and other greenery. Another turn, and the snake slowed and stopped.\n\nThe town was decorated in Red, White, and Blue, and many American and Front flags fluttered in the wind. Countless townspeople had congregated on main street, and all of them were silent, their eyes searching each van hungrily. Rousseau smirked, straightened, and opened the door.\nHe never tired of the adulation, the joy on the faces of the people as he shook their hands and exchanged short words. This particular crowd had a reason to be grateful, beyond the watchful presence of fifty or so soldiers. The old mill had been reopened, new technology rapidly coursing in to rejuvenate the town. Already, the former husks of main street seemed beamed with new coats of paint and all the shiny products rationing would permit. Rousseau stole a last, quick gaze at the crowd, before a waiting group of suited men escorted him away.\nThe new-old mill was a marvel. It had been abandoned for well over a decade, and now it had a sheen of newness. The assembly line whirred away almost silently, while workers busily assembled the objects that slowly moved their way. Rousseau noted a portrait of him that hung on the opposite wall with a satisfied grin. The factory's supervisors welcomed him onto the floor. Upon seeing him, the workers rushed away from the lines, a single conscientious technician shutting the line down just in time.\nRousseau signed everything, flashing a grin at the adoring throng."

It was ironic that it had seen something of a revival of late. Patriot Front bigwigs had found the local Balsams resort and renovated it to serve as an isolated escape from the rigors of governing their slice of America. The little town mostly had new residents, professionals in the highly relevant fields of skiing. Of the original town residents only one old man remained.\nThat old man shuffled across the newly lacquered floors, past the suites, shutting himself away in an empty, echoing chamber. The windows of the room cast a golden glow across the pale marble. The old man sat, shakily and with a curse, at the foot of a few boxes. He gingerly divested the damp cardboard of its contents, and began to read.\n\nNo one but him truly remembered the midnight elections, the food arrayed, the media's cameras eagerly drinking up the sight of the first people to cast their votes for President of the United States. The old man smiled, it was so American, wasn't it? That feeling of say, as if you had any control over where the nation would go, your little voice that could be part of a raucous wave that toppled tyrants or elected Reagans. Now that he plumbed his memories, the two seemed oddly similar. No one knew how good they had it. It is all gone now.\nThe old man slowly slid the box into the dumpster, pulled his jacket over his shoulders, and trudged off. There was one thing he knew about all they had come over his great country."

 ptf.123.t: "Unite the Right"
 ptf.123.d: "Thomas Rousseau was a man of action; it was everything he knew since the start of everything he had done in his life. Only through action and struggle could change be achieved in society; that was Patriot's Front's creed. However, now that Patriot Front had to govern and not rebel against the governing, things look quite different for their politics. Both Rousseau and his colleagues now knew a difficult truth; not everything in politics was conducted through insurgent action. Like all other functioning governments around the world, he would need to secure an alliance of different political factions within the party to secure the functioning of the PF Congress. It was something that every revolutionary, political maverick, or any run-of-the mill social justice poli-sci college student would groan at the most; coalition building in a legislature. Rousseau sat in his Boston party office that morning, laboring over these monotonous truths, and especially thinking about the hard choices he would need to make soon. He picked up a stack of papers that had a list of different people and factions within PF that he could choose from to invite into the government. He stared long and hard at the names and groups, contemplating what to do. However, it all boiled down to a few straightforward choices...\nHe could choose the \"radicals\" within PF, including members of the notorious NSC. They were quite a volatile and sinister bunch, to say the least. Their almost blatant National Socialist tendencies irritated and even alarmed a good number of people close to Rousseau. However, their radicalism could serve a purpose. They were dedicated, tenacious, and unhesitating in their struggle for the party and the movement. There was always a need for unyielding loyalty to the party's ideals in these trying times.\nHowever, if such \"radicalism\" would be too problematic for the party, moderates within the party could be an alternative. They were arguably much more cool-headed in their approach to politics and are open to at least some compromise. There was certainty that they would not cause trouble like that of members over in the NSC. Many of them are sympathetic and draw a lot from the pre-war GOP and Republican Party. They are quite establishment and professional when it comes to their politics as many of them model their policies and activities from the GOP, and especially Trump's, brand of conservatism. But as much as these potential members of the coalition are \"moderate\" in their approach in running the party, there could always be backlash that they were too moderate. People could accuse Rousseau or Congress of being too detached from PF's identity or too weak in their dedication to the cause. Worst of all, if a lot of these members were too unaffiliated regarding certain stances in the party, then finding decisive action on important or urgent policy might become much harder to mobilize.\nEven though these two approaches were very attractive, another simple choice was apparent; forget the factions or ideology and focus on the movement. Why should such worthlessly ideological and puritanical nonsense even be an option here? Patriot Front was not another one of those squabbling worthless establishment parties in other countries. Forget all this idiocy! This party is not called the \"NSC Party\" or \"Moderate Party\"; it is called the Patriot Front! The movement will be built around a united and singular dedication to this cause. This will be the PF's Congress objective in forming this government.\nAfter thinking about these tough choices for a bit, Rousseau picked up his pen and began writing down his final decision."

 ptf.124.d: "Representative Andrews could not sit still. Everything about his demeanor gave off a nervous restlessness. He could not stop fiddling through his paperwork and clicking on the pen he had on his desk. He had been in a hundred sessions within the Patriot Front Congress before, a hundred meetings with colleagues, and countless times when things got quite serious, but today topped all that. Today was one of the most important sessions for his entire career within the "Jacksonian" faction of the party. Today, he would learn if the Patriot Front Congress would keep its role as the party legislature... or even continue to exist at all. It was all coming quite close, and he could not stop anxiously brooding over what would come next.\nToday's important session would see PF's leader, Thomas Rousseau, deliver a long-awaited statement on the allocation of powers and duties to the PF Congress. Everyone was neatly in their seats, murmuring to each other, and awaiting their commander to hopefully give them all what they were looking for. The Jacksonians had been working overtime to make this all happen; the negotiations, the backroom meetings, the campaigning, and the discrete behind the scenes influence all hopefully would lead to this. Finally, Rousseau marched onto the podium with his typical charisma, cuing a round of thunderous applause from the Congress. As Rousseau fixed the microphone, the Congress fell silent, keenly listening to what he would say next.\n"Patriots! Comrades! Friends! Thank you for your dearest reception this morning", Rousseau began, "I come to you with both an important decision and a key change in party policy".\nRousseau paused for a second, as the Congress now with even more anticipation listened in."After great deliberation and negotiation, I am here to announce that I officially agree to the proposed agreements for the permanent delegation of powers to this party's Congress." Rousseau said with vigor.\n"Just as our founding fathers grounded this nation in separation of powers and checks and balances, this party too will be grounded in these principles! This Congress will have its important role in not just running this party, but the America of the future!" Rousseau continued triumphantly.\nThe whole Congress rose and clapped, especially the Jacksonians, who applauded and cheered with an enthusiasm not seen before.\nAndrews too rose and clapped hard with his fellow Jacksonians, knowing that their efforts had finally paid off. Congress was to keep its role and more in the future. America would get a republic not just on the model that the Jacksonians wanted, but on what the founders wanted too."

 ptf.125.d: ""You can't do this! This is illegal!" The store owner exclaimed. "You can't simply take all of this and destroy it. You don't understand how important this is to the local community!"\n"We have our orders", the Patriot Front Minuteman stated back with strong annoyance, "the material here has been reclassified as obscene and extremist. It is a criminal offense to display it publicly". Now picking up a large box next to him, the Minuteman turned over to leave the establishment and exclaimed back to the owner, "and plus, I don't care!" The store owner looked on with a mix of anger and frustration as the Minuteman left her establishment with her entire collection of gay pride and Black Lives Matter signs and stickers.\nNow joined by his comrades in hauling the massive amount of material out of the store and into the street, they reveal the extensive operation they were running for the entire city block. A large group of Patriot Front Minutemen were all hauling and heaving large amounts of items from the countless stores, businesses, and offices that lined the street. In their hands and boxes, they packed in countless numbers of gay flags, BLM signs, stickers, posters, communist red flags, books filled with transgender pornographic material, and other related... "stuff".\nAt the corner of the street, the Minutemen dumped everything they found into a giant mound and lit it all ablaze. The massive pyre of gender deviant and leftist paraphernalia could be seen a whole block down the street, illuminating the whole boulevard in the dim evening. The smell of smoldering paper and plastic from the torched flags and books saturated the air around the street, causing the few onlookers meters down the street to cover their noses, while for the Minutemen, they found it quite refreshing. The locals needed to know that in this new America, such hedonistic nonsense would no longer be tolerated, whether they liked it or not. For the civilians secretly watching from their windows, it was a moment of sadness and defeat, but for the Minutemen, it was one of the most enjoyable moments of their entire career."

The central pillar of the plan is a "Faith, Family, Nation" focus, wherein the economy is to serve the needs of the nation, its people, and their traditions first and foremost over the focus on unlimited growth that characterized the previous Neoliberal paradigm.\n\nThe strategy to promulgate this policy involves an "invest and divest" method. Small businesses shall be subsidized, while major corporations will be mandated to give a minimum of 20% of their profits to workers in the form of retirement accounts and have government-appointed positions on their boards of directors. The state shall also generously expand the welfare state off the backs of the profits from new state monopolies in pharmaceutical manufacturing and sale, alongside other assets that have been nationalized by the state."

 ptf.127.d: "Johnathan never really liked his time in high school, a sentiment that most teenagers of his stature shared. The drab routine and the boring repetitiveness of class was something his teenage angst could never overcome, even if classes would resume amidst the war. But now that the war had moved away from his town along with Patriot Front taking over, he now had to begrudgingly return to school. However, his high school had now become anything but repetitive and drab. Things had actually changed in his school with some being things he would have never expected in his class, let alone in his entire town.\nThe first couple of days of classes were quite odd to say the least. Many of the classes on gender studies were all permanently cancelled, the Pride Club was disbanded, many of the art teachers were all missing, all the non-European ethnic and minority clubs were disbanded, and interestingly enough, the gym class curriculum was completely different. Entering gym class for the day, he found that the gym was decorated with posters and flyers from Patriot Front with some bombastic imagery on display. He gazed upon images of physically massive men and soldiers on the posters in triumphant scenes of conquest that would rival the pompousness of images seen in Fascist Italy. But his attention now had to go to the front as the gym teacher, a small and pudgy man, began assembling the class for instruction... but now amidst the company of a strange new guest.\n"Alright everyone!" the gym teacher announced, "we are going to be doing things a bit differently today. Here to help us for this class is Mr. Erikson, he is from Patriot Front and will be leading today's warmup". The usually rowdy bunch of teenagers sat in intimidated silence at the sight of the young but well-built Patriot Front party functionary in his trademark blue and white uniform.\nThe Patriot Front functionary began to lecture the class, "today, we will be doing aerobic training. For our warmup, we will do a run for one mile! I expect everyone to keep up! Failure will result in the deduction of participation grade points for the day. Am I understood?"\nThe class all nodded as they filed up behind each other to prepare for their run. The Patriot Front trainer motioned to the class to begin and observed with a stern look.\nUpon seeing Johnathan gasp and stumble while running, he firmly reminded the class, "Keep up the pace people! Especially the guys! Our nation will not be built upon the lazy and slow!"\nWhoever these guys were, Johnathan thought to himself, they definitely have some strong expectations from someone like me..."

Quaint storefronts, including mom-and-pop shops, diners, soda fountains, and small businesses have lit up the area, with it being a prime example of American culture and spirit, not seen since the glory of the 1950s. American flags would be present on every corner, both 50-starred, the Betsy Ross variation, and the official banner of the group that won America back its liberty, decorated with the fasces that had motivated a nation to break its chains and revolt against their globalist repressers. Our veterans have done a number of marches and parades through the city, allowing us to honor their contributions to the Second American revolution that allowed for the triumph of the national soul, put on full display across the country.\n\nOf course, Boston isn't the only city with this phenomenon. Due to the chaos caused by the vermin, who fought so hard and so desperately to maintain their chokehold over the American populace, several cities across the nation have been completely rebuilt from the ground-up, allowing for a cultural and national rebirth. The declinism that has plagued our cities and left them to decay has officially been reversed, and it has ensured that the revival of ancient culture to fight back against progressivism will not stop here. This has also done wonders for the economy, as now more than ever are patriots using their hard-earned cash to build a prosperous society, both culturally and economically."

The saying went, "If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere". For so many years, this country was the land of prosperity where millions clawed and clamored to get into. Now that is all gone, and it seems that the opposite has now arrived. It used to be that the world begged for America's charity, now it seemed that America needed the world's charity for its own survival.\nThe numbers had already come into every office within the Patriot Front. None provided any good outlooks, instead it all painted an apocalyptic picture. Page after page detailed things that would make any American's stomach churn. The homelessness, the poverty, the starvation, the suffering, it was all on a scale that nobody could even dream of. The largest packet of information detailing this found its way to the office of the speaker of the Patriot Front Congress. He read it, all of it, and felt a sense of doom that he had not felt in a while. The previous day he addressed the rest of the Congress with a proposition that many initially thought unthinkable; ask for foreign economic assistance. At yesterday's session, many did not make that big of a scene about it, but he expected a lot of resentment to follow. The perceived tarnishing of America's pride was something few would tolerate.\nHowever, today he continued reading through all the horrid data but also going through a lot of the representative's responses on the motion to ask for foreign aid. Most of the responses from representatives were quite supportive, but more out of pragmatic recognition that prolonging America's suffering would do PF no good. It seemed that the measure would go through, that America would get the aid it needed, until he examined the last letter in the pile. He picked up the letter, opened it, and read the header, only for his heart to drop to the bottom of his stomach.\nThe letter was from the dreaded members of the NSC. Its contents were anything but supportive. The contents ranted and raved about selling out to foreigners, betraying the nation, and other wild accusations. The violent diatribe rendered in pen and paper was a bit too much even for the speaker's ear. He put it down, sighing to himself that he would probably be dealing with their wrath in the future.

 ptf.131.d: "Joshua Gilberg was one of the most recent additions to Yale University's social and political science faculty. A somewhat young but distinguished scholar in American political science and conflict studies, he had been through a few different universities on his journey to his most prized institution - Yale University, the best of the best. As with many of his colleagues, he had quite the record as a dedicated activist to a variety of causes for social justice on campus. When the students demanded concessions from the faculty, he was there with them; when the workers demanded better wages, he was there with them; and when the local citizens protested for racial equality, he was there with them.\n\nSince the start of the war, however, he knew that things would be very different. It was easy for him to publish papers and seminars firing the harshest of accusations and criticisms at the insidious racists or populists when they could never fire back. But now, since the Patriot Front took over the town, they finally had their chance to do so - and their strike would be fatal.\n\nParalyzed with terrible fear, Joshua could only simply stare at the fidgeting door as the officers on the other end attempted to break it down. Wooden splinters layered the cold floor as the door finally busted open, several Patriot Front "minutemen" members marching inside, accompanied by some local police officers. He was met by the icy glares of the masked militiamen as he was forcibly hoisted from his chair. "Joshua Gilberg," one of them spoke, "you are under arrest for charges of terrorism, treason, vandalism, and association with multiple criminal enterprises. You will be coming with us."\n\nThe officers hauled off the professor to the doorway, where a vehicle was waiting outside to take him to his fate - and as the same with the professors of Italy in 1922 and Germany in 1933, Joshua Gilberg would be soon joining them in the grave."

 ptf.132.t: "Building Upon Our Great Predecessors of the Past" 
 ptf.132.d: "In building our movement, we must not ignore that we are a product of a movement and idea that stretches far into the past. The fight for the defense of the western world against the forces of Communism, anarchy, and degeneracy goes back many years. Mussolini, Hitler, Mosely, Franco, and many other forged movements that struck fear into the heart of the leftist menace. However, they are all gone now, and we stand today in the seat of great power and ready to continue their great legacy. The question is, who shall we take the greatest inspiration from?\nWe first can take note of the great progenitor of them all, Italian Fascism under Benito Mussolini. How could one ever deny the great forerunner himself? How could anyone not recognize his own triumph is creating Europe's first fascist state? Mussolini and the Italian Fascists laid the groundwork and core ideas that almost every regime utilized ever since. Even Hitler himself, the most recognizable man in the world of politics, utilized a lot from Mussolini's theories. We shall, like many others, embrace many of his ideas, such as the corporatist state, the supremacy of the state over the individual, the importance of the Duce, and other ideas. Mussolini's legacy will continue to live here! If anyone else lambasts us for being "fascist" and other silly terms, we shall tell them as they used to say in Italy... Me Ne Frego!\nOur other option is to look more closer to our own western Anglo-Saxon ancestry, Mosely and the British Union of Fascists. Unlike the movements of mainland Europe, Mosely's movement is the most familiar to our joint Anglo-Saxon heritage. He recognized the importance of England's national traditions and aimed at both radical change and preservation of national character. Perhaps the stances of Mosely's BUF will serve us the best as out of all the movements in Europe it seems the most accommodating to our own national character. We shall stand in unison with our ancestors back home in northern Europe and follow in their footsteps.\nFinally, we can discard it all and simply look to the closest thing we already have; ourselves. Why should we even look to someone else for an idea on how to build our society? We are not Italians, or Germans, or British for the matter of fact; we are Americans! We are a great nation with a rich history and tradition. We shall use our own experiences, ideas, and unique stances completely independent from everything else. If we simply try to take from others when we ourselves already have something to use, then we squander our own stance as the defenders of this nation's great legacy and identity."

 ptf.133.d: "The Second American Civil War is more than just a conflict over land or resources, or even pure politics; it is something much more. This war is a battle not just for the here and now, but for the future of this nation. Every single soldier, every army, every little statelet, every idea that is bleeding and dying now on America's wide fields is bleeding and dying to stake their claim to the future; a battle for the future that Patriot Front is very well aware of. Nations are a product not just of their people, but of their historical destiny and the will of their most loyal sons and daughters.\nOur future is not of left or right, not of Republican or Democrat, not of the hammer and sickle or the swastika, but of America, something higher than everything else. The globalists, the internationalists, the traitors, the scheming profiteers, and our countless enemies, in their moronic and simple worldview, have made the mistake of condemning us as some average rabble of bandits and killers. They all claim that our future is mere death and reactionary squalor, but it will be far from anything they have ever seen.\nOur future is of great triumph and glory! America's rotten and cancerous modern façade will be torn down and its place on the bedrock of American tradition will rise a new nation; a nation reclaimed. A nation of order, discipline, culture, power, and victory will bring about a new age unlike any other. This country will be united around its holy purpose and its glorious legacy as destined by our great forefathers so many years ago. Just as we commanded the high seas, conquered the far plains of this continent, created the greatest minds of generations, and influenced the destinies of so many abroad, we too shall do the same for years to come. This new America will not know the degeneracy and failure that has cemented itself for decades upon decades in the America of old. The hedonism, the greed, the intrigue, the disloyalty, the idiocy, and all the failures that were celebrated as modern virtue will be examined in this new America as we now examine the primitive Neanderthals, backwards and disgusting. The nations of the future will put us down in the history books for eons to come, like that of the Romans or Greeks. "Reclaim America" was never just a slogan, it was a window, a window to our destiny as a nation.\nThis all was something every man in Patriot Front knew, and they would make sure the whole world would know this very soon..."

 ptf.134.d: "The Second American Civil War wreaked cataclysmic havoc on the national economy. Already troubled by the major recession caused by COVID-19, the civil war threw the economy into a death spiral arguably just as bad or worse than the 1929 Great Depression. This all meant people lost jobs, businesses closed, factories shut down, homelessness increased, and savings destroyed. New England was no different than the rest of the nation when it came to its economic woes, but Patriot Front was going to change that.\nA large subsection of Boston had recently become a model showcase for Patriot Front's newly touted "National Revival Plan"; a radical new agenda for reconstructing the US economy. The area was cleared of all debris from the war, old or damaged buildings were demolished, the homeless were removed, and the burnt out remains of the local Democratic Party headquarters was converted into a small information center for Patriot Front's local administration. However, the grand centerpiece of the reconstruction and remodeling of the area was a brand-new factory opened by a food packing company made with generous material assistance and coordination by the Patriot Front. Now that life had returned to some normalcy, along with some "encouragement" by Patriot Front, the floundering business moved from New York to that segment of Boston expecting some decent turnaround. The ceremony for the opening of the factory was kicked off with typical Patriot Front fanfare with even the leader of Boston's Patriot Front party apparatus appearing to give a brief speech.\nThe speech was not lengthy but highlighted some of the aims of the project and some touted immediate benefits... along with typical Patriot Front ideological grandstanding.\n"This project is expected to employ hundreds from the local Boston community with good wages and a strong sense of purpose for a community scarred from the failures of the past", the party leader announced."\n"Our nation will rise again when its people have purpose and discipline. The main step to this is hard work and order! Not only do individuals need such direction for success, but society too! The reclamation will be paved with such success!" The crowd watching clapped and cheered at the thundering speech, but most importantly, for the fact that they now could get a stable livelihood; a rare thing these days."

These dedicated fighting men of the party are the Minutemen, ready like that of their forefathers centuries ago to go to arms at a minute's notice for defending the nation. They have been with us since the birth of the movement and have slogged through the toughest of battles from the smallest towns to the biggest cities. However, this war will require more than just shooting and killing our enemies. Like many other organs of our party that have been assigned specific duties and objectives, the Minutemen too must be assigned. The time has come to make a choice of how the Minutemen shall contribute to the cause.\nOur first option is the most straightforward and traditional, they will go and fight at the front like everyone else. The Minutemen are a formation dedicated to combat, why should we assign them to something that would be so alien to their true purpose? Why must we deny them their destiny? Like the "M" battalions of Mussolini's Black shirts, they will receive their own dedicated combat formations and fight alongside our regular forces. They will no longer be merely a "paramilitary" group, but instead, an army ready to fight in the most heated of battles against the toughest of opponents. Their dedication, their fanaticism, and their faith will carry them to victory at the front; we are certain of this. Like the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marines present in the armed forces of countries, they too will become a critical component of our own armed forces.\nOur second option is not as bombastic but may prove highly important in the long run. We will assign them to aid and support the civilian population. How would we be able to win this war if the civilian population behind us is starving, homeless, or dead? We cannot reclaim an America of corpses and rubble. The Minutemen will make sure that the American people will remain safe, secure, and well supported during these tumultuous times. They will be assigned to work that can be closely referred to as "humanitarian" or "philanthropic" in nature. Members of the Minutemen will help clean the streets, donate food, clear rubble, rebuild homes, administer medical assistance, and other related activities. The people will have faith in our movement when they see that there is security and order under our rule. However, if they still itch for a fight, we will give them the clearance to hunt down gangsters, looters, criminals, and scavengers who are all preying on a society under the stress of war. As other loyal members of our movement fight at the front, the Minutemen will be fighting their own battle behind the lines, the battle to keep society safe and afloat."

But no, this is not some terrible nightmare or some far-off exotic nation you see on television. This is America, in the here and now.\nWhat to do? Where to even start? At least during the war, the final objective was a straightforward endeavor. Now there are no more enemies to defeat, no more hostile statelets to conquer, and nobody else to get in our way. We alone are now accountable for America's future and wellbeing. It is shocking to simply step back and consider that a political group that used to consist of just a few hundred core members now control the destinies of almost 300 million people. Has America been reclaimed? Or have we simply "reclaimed" a mountain of ash, trash, and bloody corpses?\nNo! We did not fight through thick and thin to quit on America in its moment of great need. The nation has been betrayed and ruined by countless internal and external enemies; they will not be allowed to ruin it again. Under our watchful leadership and guidance, this nation will rise again and find itself on the seat of global greatness.

All the vested forces within the state, economy, party, and most importantly, the people, will be mustered for the rebuilding of America.

 ptf.141.d: "This war for the heart and soul of the American nation and people will naturally encounter opportunists and other illegitimates cloaked in a thin veil of self-promoted righteousness; but we see through their disguise. The Republican Party of both pre-war America and current times have abandoned the cause of the American nation for the disgraceful cause of self-profit and intrigue. They spend millions of dollars to speak with such certainty to the American people that they are the champions of American patriotism and conservative values but have demonstrated anything BUT championing such causes. Under their stewardship America has decayed and the people they claim to defend have fallen into degeneracy and failure. Their cadre is stacked with globalists, rich usurers, morons, and other creatures that belong in a jail cell. The rot they hide under their suits and ties has now been exposed to the world and we see it in its entirety. Their degenerate pudgy self-appointed messiah is the worst offender of them all, Donald Trump.\nHow is it that the so-called "lion" of the cause for America was for ninety percent of his existence some opulent Democrat globalist from New York? That plump orange buffoon spent more time with prostitutes, porn stars, and queer transgender freaks rather than fighting for true conservative values. His life's greatest works are built on the most decrepit and rancid of social values and society. The only place his endless stacks of casinos and kitsch opulence belongs in is Sodom and Gomorrah; he built an empire of sin, not success. His conservatism is only apparent when it provides him with the biggest profits and TV ratings. The liars and profiteers that surround him are no better. His cadre of televangelists and corporate stooges can all join him at the bottom of his golden toilet in New York!\nThese deceptions and lies do not fool us at all! We have picked up the torch of America where these Republicans and their queer false messiah Trump have abandoned long ago. The world will bear witness as we expose these liars and return the true values that America should stand for. Our reclamation will toss these fake Americans off their golden calf throne and into their true home... the trash bin!"

 ptf.142.t: "New Lessons on "Extremism"" 
 ptf.142.d: "If there is one thing that the Patriot Front cared about other than winning on the battlefield, it was cementing their ideas within every facet of American society. The local university in New Haven had recently received a highly extensive list of changes to their local curriculum. Much of the university's extensive academic bureaucracy created for education and advocacy on "far-right extremism" was all dismantled in a single day. In its place a new set of guidelines and curriculum were handed down by the PF authorities with a strong focus on communism. It was very clear what direction the new authorities wanted when it came to education.\nMost of the professors on campus were appalled at the changes, but they had to go along, lest they were to be apprehended as "terrorists" or "traitors" by the authorities. One of the history professors had to change up the entire semester schedule due to the new guidelines, especially based on the very long worded memorandum he received from the Dean's office. But he knew that the PF representatives who now controlled the university staff from out of sight offices were the real people who wrote it. The introduction was clear with its intentions...\nON THE RESTRUCTERED CIRRICULUM FOR STUDENTS OF SOCIAL SCIENCES:\nBased on the recent decisions and developments within American national society, the university curriculum is to shift its focus to educating the student body on the criminal and genocidal characteristics of communism and anarchism. These ideologies have resulted in more death and destruction than anything else on this planet. It should be our duty as educators to prevent the next generation of Americans from falling into the trap of such extremist ideas. Such beliefs that violate the safety and trust of our community have no place on our campus. The new lesson plans for the semester have been included here below.\nThe professor put down the memorandum, feeling embarrassed at how familiar the jargon was to him in the memo. They were not wrong on the subject matter per se, but he cursed himself, knowing that if he was in PF's position, he and his colleagues would probably have written and done the same exact thing."

 ptf.143.t: "The Fate of the Lion" 
 ptf.143.d: "The downtown Boston courtroom was never really the centerpiece of anything of great notice, as most mundane legal cases were, but today was a case of the century for this court. Today, all the attendees of the proceeding were in a state of pure restlessness as the jury were nervously discussing the case in the booth, journalists were scribbling down notes, citizens allowed to observe the case were murmuring to each other, and all under the watchful eye of Patriot Front Minutemen who sternly scanned the room to make sure no disturbances occurred. However, their activity was all cut to a dead silence as a couple Patriot Front Minutemen marched in the man of the hour, Donald J. Trump.\nHere he was, the patriot, the populist, the man of the people, the mighty American lion; tired and hungry and in handcuffs, now brought in for his judgement. No one in the room could believe that the man who spent so much time defying the establishment, the globalists, the leftists, and all the other forces at work against him could be reduced to such a fate. The man who so dedicated himself to American patriotism and "making America great again" was about to be condemned to prison or worse by his own fellow "American patriots". It seems that fate has a sense of irony...\n"Donald J. Trump, please rise for your sentencing", the judge ordered.\nTrump rose alongside his lawyers to which the judge then handed down his fate. "The court finds you, Donald John Trump, guilty of treason, fraud, tax evasion, conspiracy, and multiple counts of gross social indecencies. The sentence is life in prison with no opportunity for parole".\nTrump, not saying even a word, simply stood there, in the eyes of hundreds watching, and took it all in. Nobody could tell what exactly was going through his head at that moment, but his solemn seriousness indicated that he most likely knew what awaited him next. Trump and his lawyers were promptly escorted out by the same Minutemen who led him into the room at the start.\nThe exact moment of Trump exiting the court were the last sights the public ever got of the former president..."

 ptf.144.c: "Blueshirts!"
 ptf.144.d: "NJP!"
 ptf.145.t: "Unfortunate Geopolitical Circumstances"
 ptf.145.d: "A great tragedy has struck for both our cause and the entirety of civilization as we know it. The western European world has fallen to hostile forces; depriving us of some key anticipated allies in the wake of our success in North America. However, this does not mean that we are condemned to certain doom.\nAs the west has fallen, the Chinese and Russians have taken up a position of renewed prominence on the international stage. If we are to keep ourselves and America in the seat of power at the international stage, it is very necessary that we cooperate with these new powers. Even though there is a lot that is different regarding politics and values between us, that does not mean we cannot work something out with them. China and Russia have strong faith in conserving their national cultures and identities against globalist rot; that is something we duly appreciate. As much as we may differ, it is very possible that we can try to coalesce around these few similar values and make something out of it.\nOur initial overtures have so far elicited positive reactions from the Russians and Chinese. Their foreign ministries have commented that they welcome the invitation to peaceful cooperation and coexistence. They have also complemented us for disposing of pre-war organizations and statelets that were hostile to their interests, especially the rival Biden and Trump governments. Their state media outlets have now switched messaging from downplaying us to tacitly complementing us on our international diplomacy, which is a good sign of the sentiments of their ruling elite. It is currently estimated that our new-found cooperation will continue to moderately improve over the coming years.\nSome may reprimand us for "selling-out", but such decisions of cooperation are quite the contrary. If we are to survive and thrive in this new global order, then we must make arrangements that will ensure our success. It is impossible to name a state that has not done this over the course of human history."
 ptf.145.a: "Realpolitik can be useful, even for us"
 ptf.146.t: "Who Are We?"
 ptf.146.d: "What is a nation? Who are we? These are some of the questions that have been answered by countless civilizations over the course of human history. All the nations of human history that have risen from nothing and cemented their places in history all had one thing in common: they had firmly cemented in everyone's mind who they were as a people. Nations whose identities were forged from lies and fraud or allowed to become so diluted that they lost themselves all fell into decline. We will avoid allowing this country to further slide down into such a terrible fate. America is in due need of a rediscovery of what makes America the nation that it is.\nFor too long, our identity has been diluted and thrown into confusion and hysteria. The American national identity has been ruined under the guise of very nice sounding concepts such as "diversity" and "equality". The greatest damage has been done over the last few decades as their globalism and internationalism have amplified the erosion of our national consciousness that had already simmered at the point. We are here to change all of that.\nAs we march into the world from the fires of war on the North American continent, our hearts and minds will be in the right place. We will no longer have hysteria and confusion giving opportunities to our enemies abroad to sow chaos within our ranks. They will no longer be able to pull the tricks and schemes that they were able to get away with countless times with pre-war America. Both the American people and the rest of the world must know our true identity and not this false façade made by the globalists in Washington. This nation was molded and sculpted by the sons of the great Western European tradition. Washington, Hamilton, Jefferson, Franklin; were these a bunch of brown skinned homosexuals? No! The United States was cemented as a nation under the Anglo-Saxon European tradition! America was a strong power under this lineage. It will again be powerful under this sacred heritage. This will be a truth for the whole world to behold to; whether they like it or not."
 ptf.146.a: "A nation reborn!"
 ptf.147.t: "Reaching Out Across the Atlantic"
 ptf.147.d: "As much as we are a movement for America, we must also recognize that in this grand struggle for the US, Europe must also be a part of it. America was not born nor raised in a total civilizational vacuum. We are a product of European heritage, European culture, and European blood. The west will rise not only when not just America is reclaimed, but Europe too under a unified idea and movement. Now that we have secured power in an America reclaimed, it is now time to reach out to Europe and begin the fulfilling of our destiny.\nOur objective will not be that of arms or conquest, but rather with diplomacy and propaganda. We shall mobilize our diplomats and other representatives to go to major European states to improve our relations with them. Our appeals and negotiations will hopefully bring these major European nations closer to us on key geopolitical and policy positions. Just as the pre-war American regime used diplomacy to ally Europe to its transatlantic objectives, we too shall invest a similar amount of people and resources to ally Europe to our cause. Nations like Germany, Spain, Italy, the UK, France, and others will certainly appreciate our efforts to reassert a transatlantic relationship, especially in light of a resurgent China and Russia. Most importantly, we shall mobilize our activists, media organizations, and other allied or like minded associates in Europe to promote our ideas and organizations across Europe. If their leaders turn out to not want to ally with us, perhaps their citizens will grow more supportive of us instead. Our message of \"Reclaim America\" will not just be a message heard across the US, but all across Europe too!\nHopefully with our outreach efforts, we can fulfill our grander plan of uniting the western world under our wing!"

Former soldier, present traitor and future dead man. He realized the lives we wasted in the middle east but still strayed off the path to hate our nation, if things were different... who knows.\n\nTogether with his unwashed rabble of red bandits he vowed to make a final stand against us. After several days of fighting we decided enough was enough, and the building was bombed, the fallen rubble being their tombs. With that, another pillar of the red terror falls, at the least he was willing to die for his cause."

According to the announcement, the Canadian Armed Forces have officially declared their intervention against the Patriot Front, a faction that has recently emerged as the sole unifier of the region. Despite the Patriot Front's recent success, military experts still predict a Canadian victory due to their well-trained and equipped army. However, due to the recent stalemates in the border skirmishes against the Patriot Front, experts are unsure about the effectiveness of the Canadian offensive across such a vast region.\nThe international community has been taken aback by Canada's intervention, as the country initially declared non-intervention during the Second American Civil War after they were overwhelmed with refugees. Given the situation, many are questioning the Canadian government's motives for escalating the conflict. It remains uncertain how the war will unfold, with experts predicting Canadian advances in the early stages but unsure about the events afterwards."

Remaining resistance is sporadic and sclerotic, with little cooperation between police holdouts, Federal agents, and leftists. This has not prevented the death of many occupiers and their newfound collaborators.\n\nDamage to the city is most acute in the outlying regions, however there are still signs of war even in the wealthy areas. The city has rapidly lost population, with thousands of civilians fleeing south into Unionist New Jersey or west and north further into the arms of the Patriot Front. The new regime has been surprisingly willing to allow the city to empty, establishing numerous refugee corridors. Not out of the goodness of their heart, the city is vast and dense, and it will take months before it is subdued: less people, less time. "
