 ###EVENTS###
 saudi.1.t: "Salman Admitted to Hospital"
 saudi.1.d: "Early this morning the King was visited by his personal doctor due to sudden breathing trouble and back pains. According to him the breathing problems had started several weeks prior and have gotten worse since. It didn't take long for the doctor to determine he was infected with COVID-19. Information about this is being closely monitored and will be delivered to the public at a later date." 
 saudi.1.a: "Pray for the King"
 saudi.2.t: "State of the war in Yemen"
 saudi.2.d: "It has become quite apparent that this conflict has no certain end within the next five years. Our Houthi opponents have bested our men with 40 year old AKs. Though our recent offensives have failed we are stilled determined and willing to fight." 
 saudi.2.a: "More men more guns."
 saudi.3.t: "Salman's Health Fails"
 saudi.3.d: "Great uncertainty approaches. King Salman has been delivered to the emergency room following severe breathing problems. It appears that COVID has spread significantly through his system. We pray he recorvers though it may seem only one outcome is plausable."
 saudi.3.a: "Pray for the King"
 saudi.4.t: "King Salman is Dead"
 saudi.4.d: "Today, the Saudi nation mourns the loss of their monarch.\n\n This morning, King Salman bin Abdulaziz al Saud passed away at the age of 85 due to complications not long after he had been tested positive for COVID-19. While this inevitability had been dreadfully anticipated over the past several years, it's arrival has nonetheless been a shock to the nation. Various statements have trickled out from the royal family and those in positions of influence who speak fondly of the King, lamenting about his life and leadership of the country. Already, many foreign leaders have sent their condolences regarding his untimely passing, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has delivered heartfelt words regarding his father's death, wishing to honour his memory.\n\n As the funeral processes continue and prayers mount across the kingdom, the mood in the air is solemn. However, the king's passing has begun to set certain things in motion; most pressingly, an all-too familiar succession crisis. In the background, various princes have begun to spread word amongst various members of important positions and other royal family members. As the succession crisis slowly but surely begins to rear its ugly head and the time for mourning comes to a close, Mohammed's fair share of enemies within the kingdom have taken this opportunity to sow dissent towards the kingdom's de-facto leader. This process will likely continue even after the new king is crowned."
 saudi.4.a: "God help us"
 saudi.5.t: "Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Salman al Saud found dead"
 saudi.5.d: "Our young prince has met with a terrible fate! While playing the popular MMO DOTA 2, an armed gunman stormed into his room and shot him at pointblank range with a rifle."
 saudi.5.a: "One less rat to deal with"
 saudi.6.t: "Mohammed bin Salman Coronated"
 saudi.6.d: "As the official period for mourning following the death of King Salman ends, now a period of celebration begins in Riyadh: his son, Prince Mohammed, ascends to the Saudi throne as King Mohammed, the eighth ruler of a united Saudi Arabia. His coronation represents a new era in Saudi politics; for nearly seventy years, the Saudi throne had been ruled by the increasingly elderly sons of the first king, Ibn Saud. But with all the sons either dead or disqualified from succession, it falls to the new generation to rule.\n\n The matter is further complicated by Mohammed's reputation. Since solidifying his position, he has overseen a crackdown of the royal family, purging uncles and cousins on charges of treason and corruption. Few doubt the lengths he has gone to obtain his throne, but many worry how much further he will go in order to hold onto it.\n\n The king is dead, long live the king."
 saudi.6.a: "Dissent against the king will be crushed."
 saudi.6.b: "A coaltion must be formed to overthrow this corurpt despot."
 saudi.6.c: "Arabia must be freed of this monarch!"
 saudi.7.t: "Princes Protest"
 saudi.7.d: ""
 saudi.7.a: "Get your own monarch!"
 saudi.8.t: "PMCs Attempt to Arrest Mohammed"
 saudi.8.d: "Our forces have failed to neutralize the rouge prince Muhammad bin Nayef yesterday. Despite investing thousands of dollars into Private Military Companies, they have failed to deliver the desired result. 8 armed men entered Bin Salman's residence under the cover of darkness and engaged in a firefight with a in Salman's own private security, before withdrawing after failing to penetrate the resident's defenses.\n\n Unfortunately, this has brought the eyes of the world on us, with many international commentators demanding sanctions in response to supposed 'suppression of political opposition.' Thankfully, our PR team has been hard at work, and have commented that such assassination attempt was a 'sure sign that Allah wishes for his death.'"
 saudi.8.a: "Those bastards..."
 saudi.9.t: "Prince Rebellion"
 saudi.9.d: "Despite our continuous efforts at political stabilization, our country has fallen into the chaos of Civil War. The traitors Muhammad bin Nayef and Ahmed bin Abdulaziz have started open rebellion in the south of the country, forming 'the Royal Arabian Council' in their own attempt to seize the throne. In the north, liberal and youth wings have started their own rebellion, with a suspicious amount of Israeli-supplied arms in their possession. Meanwhile, protests have broken out in Mecca with rumors of a possible jihadist uprising, although we are doing our best to keep the area under control. Breaking open the great bank of wealth that the Saudi Royal Family owns, we will do everything in our power to restore civil order."
 saudi.9.a: "God help us..."
 saudi.10.t: "Jihadists Organize in Mecca"
 saudi.10.d: ""
 saudi.10.a: "More sheep to the slaughter!"
 saudi.10.b: "We are allah's warriors"
 saudi.11.t: "Shia Militias Organize"
 saudi.11.d: ""
 saudi.11.a: "More sheep to the slaughter!"
 saudi.12.t: "Russia Remains Defiant on Oil"
 saudi.12.d: ""
 saudi.12.a: "Reduce the price of oil and flood the market."
 saudi.18.t: "Aahya Assiri Returns to Saudi Arabia"
 saudi.18.d: "Political exile and human rights activist Yahya Assiri has returned to Saudi Arabia following the civil unrest that has started recently. A former Saudi Air Force pilot, he applied for political asylum in the United Kingdom following the arrest of several prominent members of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association.\n\n His return to the country has sparked widespread controversy, with young liberals praising him and welcoming him with open arms, while conservatives slamming him for being a traitor and western spy.\n\n With his return, Assiri has announced that he will be committed to ideals of non-violence, yet how subsisted those promises truly are is questioned by many among our administration."
 saudi.18.a: "Another Charlatan."
 saudi.19.t: "Failed PMC Coup"
 saudi.19.d: ""
 saudi.19.a: "A close call!"
 saudi.24.t: "Safar al-Hawali Denounces the King"
 saudi.24.d: "Safar al-Hawali, a prominent Islamic scholar and leader of the Sahwah movement has denounced Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this afternoon. Calling him an 'Israeli Puppet', he has continued his demands for the removal of American troops and cultural influences from the Arabian Peninsula. This comes at a time where political divides rip through the country, with the many international observers eyeing a possible civil war.\n\n Israel has issued a statement condemning Hawali's statement, demanding an apology for 'spreading anti-semetic conspiracy theories'\n\n Many supporters of Hawali have seemed to be mobilizing in preparation for a 'great jihad against the west', as religious extremism and factionalism threaten to tear the country apart at its roots"
 saudi.24.a: "The old man needs his rest."
