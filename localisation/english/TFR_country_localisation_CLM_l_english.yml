 clm.3.t: "California Militias Revolt"
 clm.3.d: "With the the fight against the Communist insurgency in California raging on, hostilities between the former allies of the California State Militia, who have de-facto operational control over Northern California, and the State Government of California, who have operational control in Southern California, have spiralled into full on conflict.\n\nAt the start of the Civil War, an uneasy alliance between the Trump-aligned militia and the Biden-aligned state government was formed in order to combat what is seen as an communist terror group which streches from Santa Rosa to Santa Barbara. However, as the insurgency has spread Eastwards, cracks in the alliance have shown as conflicts over ammunition, food distribution and chain of command have increased hostilities between the 2 factions. Tensions reached a breaking point when an artillery misfire by the State Government resulted in the deaths of 4 militiamen.\n\nWhile the militia has pledged to \"Restore order to California by any means necessary\", the State government has pledged to \"continue the fight against all traitors, whether they be far-left, far-right, or anything in between\"."
