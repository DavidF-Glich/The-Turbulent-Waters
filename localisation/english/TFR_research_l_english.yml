Another aspect which is useful for those concerned with security, quantum cryptography presents a great boon and threat to digital protection."
 basic_encryption:1 "Encryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_encryption_desc: "Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. The generation of such keys depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems to produce one-way functions. Effective security only requires keeping the private key private; the public key can be openly distributed without compromising security."
 improved_encryption:1 "Encryption - Hash Functions"
 improved_encryption_desc: "A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size onto data of a fixed size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. Hash functions are often used in combination with a hash table, a common data structure used in computer software for rapid data lookup. Hash functions accelerate table or database lookup by detecting duplicated records in a large file."
 advanced_encryption:1 "Encryption - Modern Implementation of AES"
 advanced_encryption_desc: "The Advanced Encryption Standard, also known by its original name Rijndael, is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001. AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution–permutation network and is efficient in both software and hardware. Unlike its predecessor DES, AES does not use a Feistel network. AES is a variant of Rijndael which has a fixed block size of 128 bits, and a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits."
 near_future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Device-Independent Quantum Cryptography"
 near_future_encryption_desc: "A quantum cryptographic protocol is device-independent if its security does not rely on trusting that the quantum devices used are truthful. Thus, the security analysis of such a protocol needs to consider scenarios of imperfect or even malicious devices. Several important problems have been shown to admit unconditional secure and device-independent protocols."
 future_encryption:1 "Encryption - Post-Quantum Cryptography"
 future_encryption_desc: "Post-quantum cryptography refers to cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms) that are thought to be secure against an attack by a quantum computer. The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm."
 basic_decryption:1 "Decryption - Public-Key Cryptography"
 basic_decryption_desc: "A potential security vulnerability in using asymmetric keys is the possibility of a "man-in-the-middle" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party and then modified to provide different public keys instead. Encrypted messages and responses must also be intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for different communication segments, in all instances, so as to avoid suspicion."
 improved_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hash Attacks"
 improved_decryption_desc: "There is a long list of cryptographic hash functions, but many have been found to be vulnerable and should not be used. Many cryptographic hashes are based on the Merkle–Damgård construction. All cryptographic hashes that directly use the full output of a Merkle–Damgård construction are vulnerable against length extension attacks. This makes the MD5, SHA-1, RIPEMD-160, Whirlpool and the SHA-256 / SHA-512 hash algorithms all vulnerable against this specific attack."
 advanced_decryption:1 "Decryption - AES Side-Channel Attacks"
 advanced_decryption_desc: "Side-channel attacks do not attack the cipher as a black box, and thus are not related to cipher security as defined in the classical context but are important in practice. They attack implementations of the cipher on hardware or software systems that inadvertently leak data. Due to the accepted reality that AES is unbreakable, this is the primary mode of attack against it."
 near_future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Hypothetical Quantum Security Attacks"
 near_future_decryption_desc: "A rise in quantum encryption calls for advances in respective decryption. By modifying age-old methods, and developing uniquely quantum attacks, the balance of security will remain uncertain."
 future_decryption:1 "Decryption - Post-Quantum Security Research"
 future_decryption_desc: "In cryptography research, it is desirable to prove the equivalence of a cryptographic algorithm and a known hard mathematical problem. These proofs are often called "security reductions" and are used to demonstrate the difficulty of cracking the encryption algorithm. In other words, the security of a given cryptographic algorithm is reduced to the security of a known hard problem. Researchers are actively looking for security reductions in the prospects for post quantum cryptography."

 power_plants5_desc: "Being able to exploit every bit of energy that fossil fuels can produce, and then refining the resulting waste into something useful will make our industries even more efficient."
 nuclear_reactors: "Nuclear Reactors"
 nuclear_reactors_desc: "Through a fission nuclear chain reaction, nuclear reactors are capable of producing vast amounts of energy with relatively little investment. Though costly to produce, the benefits may outweigh the downsides."
 nuclear_reactors1: "Nuclear Reactor Construction Methods"
 nuclear_reactors1_desc: "With safety and future developments in mind, new nuclear reactors must be constructed in a specific way to avoid delays."
 nuclear_reactors2: "Efficient Nuclear Reactors"
 nuclear_reactors2_desc: "Directing excess production into other production lines can turn nuclear reactors even more efficient."
 nuclear_reactors3: "Improved Nuclear Reactors"
 nuclear_reactors3_desc: "Improvements in nuclear reactor technology allow for the construction of larger complexes."
 nuclear_reactors4: "Advanced Nuclear Reactors"
 nuclear_reactors4_desc: "Integrating nuclear reactors directly into the power grid will provide the population with as much power as they could ever need."
 energy_farms: "Energy Farms"
 energy_farms_desc: "From wind to solar energy, energy farms utilize natural and renewable energy sources instead of relying on fossil or atomic fuels."
 energy_farms1: "Modern Energy Farms"
 energy_farms1_desc: "Streamlined construction methods result in energy farms that can be erected very quickly."
 energy_farms2: "Improved Energy Farms"
 energy_farms2_desc: "By making the most of available sites, improved energy farms can produce more energy in smaller areas."
 energy_farms3: "Advanced Energy Farms"
 energy_farms3_desc: "With automated systems adjusting the various energy collectors according to weather, time of year and even the position of the Earth and Moon, advanced energy farms are capable of exploiting nearly 100% of available energy."
 energy_farms4: "Energy Farming Methods"
 energy_farms4_desc: "Mass adoption of renewable energy sources into urban architecture and private households will free even greater amounts of energy to be used by our industries."
 ENERGY_XOR_DESC: "Only §Yone§! of these technologies can be researched."

 nukes: "Nuclear Warheads"
 nukes_tech_effect: "Enables §H$nukes$§!\n   $MODIFIER_NUCLEAR_PRODUCTION$: §GYes§!\n"
 nukes_desc: "A nuclear weapon is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb). Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter"
