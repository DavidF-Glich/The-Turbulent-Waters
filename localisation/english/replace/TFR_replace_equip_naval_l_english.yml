 ### STANDARD NAVAL ##
 destroyer: "Corvette"
 destroyer_desc: "A corvette is a small warship. It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper warship. Modern navies began a trend in the late 20th and early 21st centuries towards smaller, more manoeuvrable surface capability. They are usually armed with medium- and small-caliber guns, surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and antisubmarine weapons. Many can accommodate a small or medium antisubmarine warfare helicopter."

 heavy_cruiser:1 "Destroyer"
 heavy_cruiser_desc: "A large armored cruiser that is pretty flexible. A good choice for nations who can't afford to build larger capital ships."
 both_cruisers_desc: "A frigate is a type of warship, having various sizes and roles over the last few centuries. In modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships, especially as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys.\n\nIn naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. At the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships. "

 battleship: "Missile Cruiser"
 battleship_desc: "Modern cruisers are generally the largest ships in a fleet after aircraft carriers and amphibious assault ships, and can usually perform several roles. In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant after the aircraft carrier. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense and shore bombardment."

 carrier_desc: "An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations."

 submarine_desc: "A submarine is a watercraft capable of independent operation underwater. The primary defense of a submarine lies in its ability to remain concealed in the depths of the ocean. A concealed military submarine is a real threat, and because of its stealth, can force an enemy navy to waste resources searching large areas of ocean and protecting ships against attack."
