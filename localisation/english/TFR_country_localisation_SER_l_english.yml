 SER_policy_of_pragmatism_desc: "The disaster that unfolded following the Yugoslav Wars have left Serbia isolated, devastated and internationally shunned after Milošević's violent presidency. Yugoslavia as an entity ceased to exist in 2006 with Montenegro's and Serbia's secession, and with none to turn to but Russia and the successors of the Soviet Union, Serbia was left to its own devices. Until the reality of Russia's stagnation began to resonate with many politicians, Serbia began opening up their ties to NATO and the EU much to the chagrin of Serbia's old elite. The emerging situation of Serbia on the international stage was a state of opportunistic pragmatism - pitting the EU against China in investments while participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, fostering closer ties to Russia while actively making an effort to join the EU to open up the economy. While unlikely to join NATO anytime soon with the Kosovo dispute still remaining unsolved, Serbia has very much taken advantage of its position as a non-aligned state in Europe - and the divide between pro-western and eastern parties only seems to be widening. Only time will decide which side of the world will win over Belgrade."
 SER_rebellion_of_kosovo: "The Birthright Lost"
 SER_rebellion_of_kosovo_desc: "Following Yugoslavia's collapse was the manifestation of a nightmare that any Serbian nationalist would refuse to believe. The Albanians in the province of Kosovo rebelled as the Federal Republic dissolved, capturing ethnic Serbs in their violent secessionism as the imperialists of NATO bombed Belgrade in their support. An Albanian ethnostate was built on the foundations of our proud history, touting itself as an insult to the Serbian people with their illegitimate nation. So long as Pristina stands with the accursed navy blue flag at high mast, the legitimacy of Serbia and her pride as a regional power will be forever at stake. §RWe will retake Kosovo, regardless of the means necessary.§!"

Aleksandar Vučić's unexpected presidential bid was marred with alleged corruption perpetrated by Serbia's societal elites and the clamping down on press freedom through legal and smear campaigns, alongside Vučić's push to increase the constitutional powers of his previously mostly-ceremonial position as president - all of which a stark contrast to his campaign promises to combat against the very things he is alleged of doing. The international community has begun their barrage of our descent into supposed authoritarianism, and it seems as if it will only get worse in the coming years."

 SER_emerging_economy_desc: "Even as the struggles of the last decades left a dark mark on our history, the Serbian people have managed to persist and work hard to rebuild their nation. With the introduction of a new growing market economy, Serbia has been flooded with investments worldwide, both from blue-chip companies from the West and Russian gas companies such as GAZPROM forming their own branches on our fertile soils. Despite such progress however, Serbia hasn't truly recovered from its collapse as a major European power, and the imprint of corruption on our society and economy hasn't been truly washed away with our introduction to capitalism. Only judicial reforms and more transparency will stave off kleptocrats from leeching on our hard work."

 #News Events
 news.287.t: "Socialists Takeover Serbia"
 news.287.d: "The recent snap elections within Serbia have provoked great upset as challenger Aleksandar Vulin and the Movement of Socialists party have secured a win and consolidated significant political power in the country. The recent political and social upheavals rocking Europe and America along with serious domestic upheavals within the last few months have driven Serbian voters towards candidates and parties promising order and stability. Vulin and his socialists have called for a government that can secure order, security, and a good life for the population, something that has won massive appeal amongst Serbian voters. Most interestingly, Vulin has appealed to Yugonostalgia, the presidency of Slobodan Milosevic, and even a desire for future reunification of Yugoslavia, proving popular with older voters. Utilizing a lot of popular discontent and appeals to order, Vulin and the Movement of Socialists have secured unchallenged dominance within the Serbian government. Along with consolidating utter dominance within the state, Vulin and his fellow socialists have begun moves to, as his cabinet have stated, "prepare for a future socialist Serbia and Yugoslavia". A variety of neighboring states in the Balkans have already condemned Vulin's public admiration for Milosevic and desires for Yugoslav reunification, calling them "unrealistic" and "dangerous". However, the Vulin administration seems undeterred as many brace for the future collision between a socialist nation wishing to resurrect the past and other nations who want to stay far away from such things."

 news.288.t: "Vucic Consolidates Serbia"
 news.288.d: "The recent snap elections within Serbia have provoked great upset as incumbent Aleksandar Vucic and the Serbian Progressive Party have secured a win and consolidated significant political power in the country. The recent political and social upheavals rocking Europe and America along with serious domestic upheavals within the last few months have driven Serbian voters towards candidates and parties promising order and stability. Vucic and the dominant SNS party have successfully utilized such sentiments, appealing in their campaigns with promises of peace, order, stability, and a sense of security. This tried-and-true electoral strategy has once again carried Vucic and his party to unchallenged success in the aftermath of these elections. With their newfound dominance within the Serbian government, Vucic and his colleagues have also move forward with new domestic security laws and regulations cracking down on certain political parties and activist groups. These new changes are cited by Vucic as a necessary step for Serbia in a world dominated by "extremism, violence, and war". Already, many pro-western NGOs and opposition activists have decried the recent win and other actions by the new government as autocratic and illegal. These calls have so far been ignored as the government still intends to move forward with its new security and political reforms. It seems that "peace and stability" have returned to Serbia."

 news.289.t: "Serbian Far-Right Rises"
 news.289.d: "As the rest of Europe struggles to contain new and radical political parties and candidates, Serbia is seeing the resurgence of something quite familiar; far-right nationalism. Under the leadership of Vojislav Šešelj, the Serbian Radical Party and other nationalist groups have seen groundbreaking success in national level elections and support amongst the population. Appealing to the anger and frustration of Serbia's humiliation during the 1990s, many Serbians are throwing in their support in anticipation that such national wrongs will be avenged. The massive gains and subsequent seizure of power within the Serbian government by Šešelj and other nationalists have prompted a variety of positive reactions by Serbs and negative responses by those who are not. Many surrounding nations and liberal NGOs are condemning Šešelj, his party, and other allied nationalist groups as "genocidal", "autocratic", and "threatening the stability of the Balkans". Regardless of criticisms, it seems that Serbia's nationalists are poised to put Serbia back on the path of confrontation with its neighbors as talk of "reclaiming lost territories" is becoming quite frequent within the government. Time will tell if war comes to the "powder keg of Europe" once more."
