No longer confined to the fringes, Le Pen's victory represents the culmination of decades of work by the National Rally to position itself as the voice of the disillusioned, the frustrated, and the forgotten. \n\nWith renewed power in hand, Le Pen promises to enact sweeping reforms to restore French sovereignty, curb immigration, and challenge the European Union's influence over France.

#Descriptions
 POLITICS_EMMANUEL_MACRON_DESC: "Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron is a former investment banker, former minister, and current President of the Fifth Republic of France. At a young age and having been raised in a non-religious household, he asked to be baptized into the Catholic Church. However, he would later declare himself agnostic, and embraced left-leaning ideology which he attributes to his grandmother. He studied philosophy and economics at the École Normale Supérieure and later attended the École Nationale d'Administration. After completing his studies, he worked as an investment banker for Rothschild & Cie Banque, where he earned his first million on a nine billion dollar deal he helped broker. In 2012, he was appointed Minister of the Economy, Industry, and Digital Affairs which e resigned from In 2016 to launch his Presidential campaign.\n\nAs President, Macron has pursued an agenda of economic reform, including reducing public spending and labor market deregulation.  His presidency has been tainted by widespread protests, including the ''Yellow Vest'' movement, which began in late 2018 in response to proposed fuel tax increases. Macron has referred to France's colonization of Algeria as a ''crime against humanity,'' and intervention in Libya as a ''historic error.'' Meanwhile, France still exerts its influence over the vulnerable countries of West Africa from the shadows, and it is unclear how far Macron is willing to go to preserve French interests. Despite these challenges, Macron remains a prominent figure on the international stage, advocating for global cooperation on issues such as climate change, international security, and unity between European nations."

Educated in philosophy and economics, Mélenchon's intellectual curiosity and commitment to social justice led him to a career in politics. As a former teacher and activist, he understands the power of education and grassroots organizing in effecting meaningful change. \n\nAs a leader, Mélenchon is known for his fiery rhetoric and uncompromising principles.

Faure's career in politics began as an advisor and quickly evolved into a leadership role, reflecting his deep commitment to the ideals of socialism. \n\nAs president, Faure advocates for a France that prioritizes social equity, environmental sustainability, and economic justice.

 FRA_form_a_scientific_committe_to_combat_the_pandemic_desc: "The new COVID-19 pandemic has already begun to spread at a rapid rate throughout France, Europe, and the wider world, after the local authorities in Wuhan and the rest of China failed to prevent its spread. While the pandemic will continue to spread and the virus isn't going away anytime soon, the first step to fighting the virus is understanding it, and to do that the French government will have to form a scientific committee. The committee, which will consist of experts from various fields such as pathology, biology, and economics, as well as individuals from various government agencies, will be able to draft an initial series of plans and recommendations for the French government to implement in our fight against COVID-19."
 FRA_research_the_vaccine: "Start Vaccine Research"
 FRA_research_the_vaccine_desc: "The SARS-CoV-2, popularly known as the covid-19 or coronavirus, has already proven to be highly infectious and capable of causing dangerous and potentially fatal diseases in those it infects, with many hospitals already running out of ventilators to help treat patients. While methods such as lockdowns and masking are already being considered and in some places implemented, it is clear that a vaccine will be required to truly put an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scientific committee has already met with delegates from major French biotechnology corporations, including Sanofi Pasteur, and has recommended that research and development of a vaccine begin immediately."
 FRA_enforce_a_lockdown_to_buy_time: "Proclaim Lockdown Mandate"
 FRA_enforce_a_lockdown_to_buy_time_desc: "The rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has already begun to overwhelm the ability of many hospitals in France to receive new patients, and it is clear that drastic measures must be undertaken to prevent the further spread of the pandemic. The scientific committee has recommended mass lockdowns, which, while almost certainly leading to a severe chilling effect on the French economy in the near-term, will likely save tens of thousands of French lives and take a large amount of pressure off the national healthcare system."
 FRA_ease_the_restrictions: "Loosen The Mandate"
 FRA_ease_the_restrictions_desc: "It is clear that neither our economy nor society can handle the current lockdown restrictions. To ensure that our political situation doesn't spiral out of control, we must loosen some of our regulations. France will weather this storm."
 FRA_keep_the_restrictions: "Strengthen The Mandate"
 FRA_keep_the_restrictions_desc: "Our doctors gave us horrifying news. It seems the previous estimates about the fatality rates were too light. What is more horrifying is that almost 45% of our elderly are dying from it (compared to just 17% from the original predictions). While it is unclear why even the most drastic predictions were proven wrong or why some other nations seem to have less severe fatality rates (perhaps the virus we are exposed to is an evolved form of the original strain?), we cannot let our people suffer from it further."
 FRA_expand_welfare_payments: "Approve Stimulus Packages"

 FRA_push_for_mass_vaccinations_desc: "With the first vaccines arriving, we can now spread them across France. We will mandate our government workers, military, and public services to vaccinate, and encourage our companies to follow this example. Of course, there is already pushback against this idea. Some people claim that we cannot force these vaccines on them. They are simply blind to the death that is unfolding even with our restrictions. We cannot pretend that everything is normal. Nothing is worth the risk."
 FRA_look_to_the_swedes: "Swedish Response, French Problem"
 FRA_look_to_the_swedes_desc: "The Swedish government had set a plan to have not set harsh COVID restrictions. As of now we still cannot know its effectiveness in terms of preventing the virus itself, yet we do know that the country managed to stabilize the economic scene. We should try to follow their example and make sure life goes on as normal. Just get more funding to hospitals, make some light restrictions and continue working everyone!"

 FRA_develop_immunity: "Foster Immunity"
 FRA_develop_immunity_desc: "While max vaccinations might be the best way to do it, we simply cannot waste our limited resources and money on independent vaccine development. However, we must also be sure to not be dependent on American Pfizer. To do that, our Health Ministry has proposed to ''foster immunity'' with our people. This is a risky gamble, but if we put money into treating the severe symptoms while the rest self-medicate using government-approved ''symptom-remover'' medicines, it just might work. They will be able to continue work like nothing ever happened."

 FRA_The_Opening_Volley: "The Opening Volley"
 FRA_The_Opening_Volley_desc: "Ever since their formation in the 70s, the National Front has been a tumultuous force in French politics. While Marine Le Pen has worked hard to root out Fascist and Petainist elements from the party, it is still considered by many to be a far right movement. Nevertheless, Le Pen has announced her campaign for president in 2022, and with the major economic issues and unrest facing France, many believe she represents a serious threat to Macron's bid to continue serving as the president of France. Only time will tell who will win the election, but the result is sure to inspire anger and polarization regardless."
 FRA_en_marche: "March With Macron"
 FRA_en_marche_desc: "Macron's victory in 2016 gave France the opportunity to finally have a republic free of radicalism and political instability, a republic that would bring peace and security to Europe and the world through collaboration and understanding, but use force when necessary against tyrannical forces. A republic that would grant new opportunities for minorities and immigrants to partake in a multicultural France while also respecting the honorable culture of France. A republic that would truly live up to the revolutionary motto of Liberté, égalité, fraternité. This is a republic that the treasonous fascists in the National Front wish to destroy, but Macron's upcoming victory in the 2022 election will see their dark hopes scattered for a final time."
 FRA_rassemblent_national: "Look To Le Pen"
 FRA_rassemblent_national_desc: "For decades, the National Front has remained on the fringes of French politics, only occasionally rising up just to fall back down into irrelevance, but with Marine Le Pen's campaign, that is finally changing. Macron's liberal establishment policies have clearly led to the near ruin of France, and it is time for change. No longer will France give up its sovereignty to unelected supranational organizations, and no longer will the will of the French people be overridden by bureaucrats in Brussels. Liberal elitists will not be given the opportunity to tear down the social safety net of the French people. Violent hordes of Islamists won't enforce their fanatic religious extremism on the French people any longer. No, in 2023 France will be free."
 FRA_the_west_african_sphere: "§YOpération§!: Éléphant"
 FRA_the_west_african_sphere_desc: "Our interests in Africa have always been obvious. The lands that used to be our colonies are still tied to us economically, linguistically and militarily. Many of the ''leftists'' claim that we must abandon this region, seeing our attempts at stabilizing this region as ''neocolonialism.'' Yet they do not understand that we cannot abandon our Francophone brethren to be eaten by jihadist and Russian-backed juntas. We must focus our efforts to bring the region under control."
 FRA_economic_assistance: "Economic Intervention" 
 FRA_economic_assistance_desc: "Our Francophone friends have always had a difficult economic situation. Constantly assaulted by insurgents, they have always been unable to develop their domestic industries as successfully as Nigeria to their south. We must change that. Our funds will reinvigorate the West African economy. And of course some of that wealth will return to us..."
 FRA_military_assistance: "Military Aid"
 FRA_military_assistance_desc: "While the economic situation in the West African region is always in need of a boost, nothing can be achieved without stabilizing the regional conflicts. Our forces have bled in this region for a decade now, yet without local government fielding effective armies it will all be for naught. Ensuring a strong network of local armies under our coordination will be key in our future plans."
 FRA_combat_islamic_terrorism: "Quell Islamic Extremism"
 FRA_combat_islamic_terrorism_desc: "While Russian influence is a looming threat that looms over our African projects, the jihadists are a more pressing threat. Dealing with them will be our immediate concern. It's not like the Russians and their puppets want the islamists to rule either. Aside from our francophone partners, cooperation from Nigeria will be essential in this operation."
 FRA_cease_social_dumping: "Cease Social Dumping"
 FRA_cease_social_dumping_desc: "We must put our people first. Our poorer areas are plagued by companies infringing on their labor. Our workers must be paid more, for it is the French ideal to cater to our rural regions."

 FRA_tackle_trade_unions_desc: "The communists always criticize us for ''not supporting the workers'' yet it is the trade Unions that constantly bicker with our industries. Their constant protests, riots, and strikes do nothing but disrupt our country's stability. Shut them down!"
 FRA_pension_reform: "Pension Reform"
 FRA_pension_reform_desc: "In a bold step towards securing France's long-term economic future, the government has decided to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. This reform is aimed at ensuring the sustainability of the pension system while adapting to the realities of an aging population and increasing life expectancy. Proponents highlight the positive impact this change will have on public finances, allowing for continued investment in social services and economic growth. While some sectors express concern, the government is confident that this necessary adjustment will foster greater resilience in the economy, promoting fairness for future generations and protecting the integrity of France's social safety net."
 FRA_eu_recovery_instrument: "EU Recovery Instrument"
 FRA_eu_recovery_instrument_desc: "While Le Pen argues that the Union is holding us back economically, it is not the case. Be it the inner-union migration or the unified market, our influence lets us achieve greater heights as long as we are united."
 FRA_support_european_federalization: "Support European Federalization"
 FRA_support_european_federalization_desc: "While we are still considered a great power, that is not entirely the case. The Americans walk over the Europeans militarily and economically. The Chinese flood our markets with cheap goods. The global south does not respect us and refuses our advice. Even Russia, a state we considered defeated and battered beyond recovery, has raised its head once more and is trying to recover their lost power. So why shouldn't we? Are Europeans, the birthplace of modern statehood, culture and technology not worthy to regain their rightful place under the sun? We must unite, for only that way can we become a great power once more!"
 FRA_immigration_regulation: "Immigration Regulation"
 FRA_immigration_regulation_desc: "The unending wave of migrants reaching our shore has long since been a topic of political discussion. While previous governments assured us that we could assimilate these people due to the fact most of them are coming from our long-lost colonies, it is clear we cannot integrate them fast enough. Lawless ghettos where no police force is present are a staple near our large cities. Our teachers are beheaded for defending the French ideal of religious deconstruction and analysis. Our women are afraid to travel the streets at night without an escort out of fear of a thug mob assaulting them. Not to mention Islamic terrorism. We need to fix our system, and stopping immigration is the way we can start doing it."
 FRA_increase_corporate_tax: "Increase Corporate Tax"
 FRA_increase_corporate_tax_desc: "The corporations have done nothing but leech off of the common Frenchman. While we can blame Macron for the current government deficit, we must also find solutions. Taxing the corporations and favoring small businesses will not only return a semblance of balance in the inner market but also flood the treasury with the money we need to fund our future projects. "

When they speak of civilization, it ultimately traces back to our national achievements. Who has given so much to arts, culture, philosophy, science, and technology? Who had spent so much time elevating millions across the world in the ideas of Enlightenment and modernity? We have been the few to do so. French is amongst the most spoken languages in the entire world and was once the lingua franca of all international diplomacy. Whole economies and national politics of foreign nations bend to our national will. In the past, French soldiers have set foot on every continent and claimed it for our glorious nation to spite other petty European empires, but as those Empires died to revolutions that we birthed from our own glorious revolution, we remained.

 FRA_yellow_vests_idea_desc: "The French economic slowdown has not been kind to the French worker. Rising crude oil and fuel prices, a high cost of living, and economic inequality have all threatened the standards of living of the everyday French worker, all while a disproportionate tax burden had fallen on the working and middle classes. In response, an online petition posted in May 2018 had attracted nearly 1 million signatures, kickstarting a protest movement that has lasted nearly 2 years.\nThe protests have been characterized by their bright yellow vests, chosen due to their unifying thread and call to arms. Protesters have blockaded roads, constructed barricades, and conducted mass marches in an opposition to neoliberalism - with elements of both the far right and far left joining in.\nThe protests have taken a violent turn, with French cities burning due to an uptick of violence as the protests have dragged on. Clashes between the police and protestors have resulted in thousands of injuries, and reports of arson, vandalism and property damage valued in the millions have run rampant. Emmanuel Macron's approval rating had dipped over 20 percent since the protests began. These protests perhaps are the first indication of a serious turn in French politics - a turn away from the liberalism of the start of the decade, and perhaps a return of the specters of extremism that have haunted France for so long."

 FRA_ENA_idea_desc: "Originally founded by Charles de Gaulle in 1945, the ENA was supposed to to democratize access to the senior civil service. As one of France's most prestigious schools, with only 80-90 students graduating every year. Within French society, the ENA stood as one of the main pathways to high positions in the public and private sectors. Indeed, 4 Presidents of France since the founding of the 5th Republic have been ENA graduates, including Emanuel Macron.\nENA graduates have been highly influential in French politics over the past 70 years, yet the recent Yellow Vest protests have called for its end. Decried as an elitist and out of touch institution, the school has been criticized for producing a ruling class with narrow thinking, ENA graduates are consistently pushed to pursue centrist policy, unable to accept alternative solutions outside of the accepted norm - a stagnation in thinking that has become worrying as the world has rapidly evolved. Worse, the ENA has been criticized for continuing the social division in France, with the majority of ENA graduates being from wealthy and influential families, with only 6 percent coming from the family of laborer's.\nThe winds of populism seem to finally have closed the ENA for good,  as on April 25th, 2019, Macron confirmed that he will close ENA. However, as France's economy meets future challenges, it is uncertain whether this decision will be reversed or not"

 FRA_french_spirit_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_FRA_french_spirit\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout the early 19th and 20th centuries, Paris was occupied twice. First in 1870, then in 1940. Since then, France has vowed never to let a foreign country occupy their lands. The French Army stands ready to defend the nation to the last. French nuclear missiles maintain an umbrella of defense around the nation, threatening all who dare threaten the homeland with hellfire.\n\nYet, the French spirit is not just about the defense of the nation, but about revolution as well. The heartland of European Liberalism and Leftism in 1789, the French radical spirit has persisted throughout the past two centuries. The French people are not ones to tolerate injustice or mistreatment, and would rather die standing than live kneeling. As such, any attempts at frustrating the will of the people will be met with mass protests, riots, and possibly revolution - a process well practiced by the French people by this point"

 FRA_mass_migration_idea_desc: "Since 1973, immigration policy in France has focused primarily on stemming and deterring migration. Despite this, France received over a hundred twenty thousand asylum applications in 2019, a number that has caused quite a rift in French politics. With economic slowdown and high unemployment slowing down the nation's economy, the immigration issue has been a hot button topic in French society.\n\nThe right, which has grown due to fearmongering about the dangers of migration has rallied for stronger borders and spread anti-immigrant propaganda. With nationalist fervor, these parties see immigration as a fundamental threat to the French identity and national security. As such, they have advocated for closed borders to end the influx of foreigners.\nRegardless, the immigration issue has been taking it's toll on French society. As it seems like the issue of whether or not to accept new immigrants becomes more and more contentious, French society becomes more and more radicalized. And as more and more immigrants come in from the war torn areas of North Africa and the Middle East, the economic strain of supporting such a refugee inflow becomes greater and greater. Sooner or later, a conclusive policy must be made."

In the 18th century, France underwent a revolution that had a profound impact on the political and social landscape of Europe, promoting ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. France's military prowess was demonstrated through Napoleon Bonaparte, whose conquests reshaped European borders.

The helmet of Lafayette was found stashed in a burnt-out car before an all out retreat was called, and although a handful bodies were recovered from the site of the ambush, there is no indicator of who is and who isn't our Great Commander. \n\nWith no body to confirm his death, his Aide-De-Camp, General Nikola Perović has announced on a makeshift stage somewhere outside the Parisian suburbs, that until the Commander is found, he will reign in his stead, and within the same breath calling for a suicidal and all-out attack on Russian lines to avenge the missing Commander."

This historical legacy has perpetuated a belief in the military's importance in protecting the nation's interests and has shaped the perception of the armed forces as a key pillar of French identity and sovereignty.\n\nAs our nation moves away from the need for a significant military control, the military is not too keen on letting go of the power they had granted themselves and must be worked with to maintain loyalty."

Of course, the status quo remains to be an attractive option for many as they confidently vote for the current ruling party. \n\nAs the voting period ends, tensions continue to mount and it remains to be seen what direction France will take in the coming years, many of the French people nervously watch the polls as slowly but surely the winner is revealed. \nAnd the winner is......"

 france.4.d: "With the political scene in France beginning to see many notable candidates step forward in their bid for the role of President of the Fifth Republic, the arrival of previously disregarded or otherwise ''fringe'' contenders has always been a sight to see in the age of 21st century politicking. Among the rumbling political movements seeking to unseat the establishment Macron and his LREM in the coming 2022 elections, it would be far from accurate to claim that Le Pen's National Rally was the sole voice for right-wing opposition to the existing government. Such was reaffirmed recently, when controversial television pundit Eric Zemmour recently took to public broadcast in his own scathing tirade of the President's leadership. \n\nAmong other unsavoury things, Zemmour railed against a plethora of Macron's policies enacted under his leadership, targeting his policies regarding the issue of immigration, accusing Macron of contributing to France's ''decline in national identity'' through his willingness towards new arrivals from the Middle East and Northern Africa. Claiming that the ''very existence of French culture, society and the French people as a whole'' were at risk of being replaced via the influx of foreign migration, the broadcast reached a tipping point when Zemmour decried Macron as being guilty of committing ''high treason'' against the people of France, causing a buzz on social media and more besides. \n\nThe broadcast by Zemmour, who has been known for his inflammatory statements and controversial rhetoric for almost a decade now, has brought him much attention as a result, with his words becoming the topic of heated debate as of recently. Though many among France's left-wing and center have naturally reacted negatively to his words, with some calling for him to be taken off the air, an increasing number of right-wingers seemingly dissatisfied with Le Pen have begun to sing Zemmour''s praises, with rising calls for the pundit to throw his hat in the ring for the office of the presidency.

 france.5.t: "Rumours in the Military"
 france.5.d: "The military of France has a long and storied history. From the great liberator Charles De Gaulle to the famed conqueror and emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, many leading figures in France's history arose from the armed forces and its institutions, causing the military's position in the French nation state to be seen as pivotal by many, especially within the military itself. Though this has led to a number of political problems that persist even in the modern day, many thought that the time of military power and influence had long since passed, with their power rightfully kept in check by the elected civilian government and the democratic process. \n\nAt least, until today. On the week of the 60th anniversary of the failed coup attempt by the French military in Algiers, news has broke across France of the workings of a ''coup d'etat'' in its planning stages, reportedly through an apparent leak within the military. A letter co-signed by over a dozen generals, both formerly and currently serving has been uncovered after being uploaded to the internet, with the letter itself making various statements and claims against the current establishment, ranging from primarily criticizing the government's apparent lack of proper funding and adequate treatment of the armed forces in an age of rising global turbulence, to more vague political notions of the ''rule of firm law and order'' and the importance of ''safeguarding France from the mortal dangers that threaten it.'' \n\nAlthough a simple strongly-worded letter is hardly enough evidence to affirmatively point to the actual threat of a military coup against the elected government, the rumours have still shaken up a decent portion of the government and the public as a whole, despite the lack of concrete evidence to support it. The signatories of the letter have been scrutinized by both public officials and non-signatory members of the command staff in response, reminding them of the military's position being generally outside the realm of politics, and the importance of strictly upholding that separation of power. For now, the rumours of some sort of action being taken against the government by the armed forces are just that... rumours."

This list of militarist concessions, including things like reinstating conscription, and removal from NATO's integrated, promised harsh political action against those who denied the concessions, but also promised that the French military would do no harm to President Macron, Le Pen, or any other politician. This letter was officially recognized by the French High Command when reports came in of multiple battalions of French soldiers beginning excersizes in strategic positions in and around Paris. \n\nPresident Macron, being in Paris, was shuttled out of Paris after being told the list of demands, while Le Pen was told of these demands during an impromptu meet and greet with soldiers outside of Paris."

 france.7.d: "Elections, like in many other democracies around the world, were quite complex affairs, but they all boiled down to one thing: competition. A candidate or a party must compete for seats of power within a state. Democracy sounded nice during speeches and in textbooks, but you often had to get a bit dirty if you wanted to make sure that you held an advantage over your opponent. Eric Zemmour fully understood all this and had used every tool in his political chest to make this all happen, even if he had to do a little... ''negotiating'' behind the scenes. \nZemmour kept thinking about all of this as he paced back and forth in his Paris office. The election was driving him mad with anticipation unlike anything he had experienced before. Everyone in France knew that it would be a tight race and that all the rival politicians had mobilized all their entrenched contacts and credibility to stop him. However, unlike all of them, he knew a few things that the average voter and rival of his did not. He was sure that he did everything right, that he talked to the right people, moved the right things, and said the right stuff. It should all work as planned. People did not know how much he had to work to get this all to come together in the way he wanted \n\nHe had his people go to countless polling machines to make sure they operated ''correctly''. He had gotten his friends in the French Armed Forces to ''certify'' that the election was going in the way it was supposed to be. He had gone countless times to the voters and told them all the things they wanted to hear no matter how many times other establishment politicians screamed that he was a ''populist''. He had done everything he could; now it was time to see if it paid off. \nNow sitting down at the flatscreen TV in his office, Zemmour turned to the first major news channel to see the results. His moment had finally come. As his eyes quickly scanned the channel's ticker tape and what was being said by the reporters, he almost jumped for joy. Everything that he had painstakingly managed was now coming to fruition. The text that now flashed on screen even further filled him with a satisfaction he had not felt in a long time..."

Demonstrators have taken to the streets, blocking highways, and clashing with law enforcement in cities across the country. The protests, while decentralized and diverse in their demands, reflect deep dissatisfaction with the political establishment and mounting frustration with President Macron's reforms. \n\nAs barricades rise, the government must decide whether to meet the protesters' demands with concessions, maintain a hard stance to restore order, or risk deeper political divisions by doing nothing.

Nobody could believe it. The highest echelons of French society were now paralyzed with loss and indecision. However, others had taken the opportunity to ''act'' on the situation in the country's ''best interests''. \n\nAs the morning went on for Paris, near the Élysée Palace, a curious scene was developing. Normally, for the weekly meetings with cabinet and parliament members, you would only be able to see the expensive cars of politicians parked outside, but today would be different. Within the first hour of the opening of the morning session, Rows upon rows of army trucks and vans came roaring towards the estate, pouring into the street and outside perimeter. They stopped abruptly as their doors and rear cargo holds opened as officers, soldiers, special forces operatives, all with FAMAS assault rifles in hand, piled out of the vehicles. The leading men of the entourage, generals decked with awards and accolades, forcefully pushed down the front doors of the estate with the soldiers and officers following. The politicians, all chit-chatting in the main hall, were all taken by total surprise by this odd intrusion. Unbeknownst to them, their time had come. \n''What in the world is going on here?! What is the meaning of this bizarre stunt?!'' one of the MPs exclaimed. \n''We are executing or constitutional duties sir.'' the lead general remarked with cold seriousness, ''we have our orders to detain all identified officials who have failed in executing their responsibilities to the nation.'' \n''You- what?!'' the MP blurted back with shock, ''This is ridiculous! This is illegal! You can't do this! This is all treason of the highest order!'' \n''No sir'', the general said as he took out his sidearm, ''it is you who have committed treason. You will be coming with us and following our exact instructions. The country's national interests have been betrayed, and we are here to make sure order is restored.'' The general then waved to the soldiers behind him, who then began fanning out to apprehend and seize the entire complex for themselves. The ''traitors'' had now been dealt with.

The announcement, made amidst promises of economic recovery and modernization, quickly ignites outrage across the nation. As the proposed changes are perceived as an attack on hard-earned worker rights, citizens from all walks of life take to the streets, leading to large-scale protests and riots that shake the very foundations of French society. \n\nThe initial demonstrations begin peacefully, with unions rallying thousands of workers, students, and retirees in major cities like Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. However, as tensions rise and clashes with police become more frequent, the protests devolve into violence. Barricades are erected, and the chants for justice turn into cries for revolution.

With nationalistic fervor in Belgium and the Netherlands diverting attention from pressing social issues, the communist movement capitalizes on the unrest, calling for solidarity among the oppressed.

As her message gains traction, rallies and protests organized by far-right groups swell in size, drawing thousands who share her vision of a France unshackled from European oversight. \n\nThe speech acted as a catalyst, sparking renewed enthusiasm among far-right factions who begin to organize more aggressively.

His platform includes proposals for wealth redistribution, environmental sustainability, and a strong anti-austerity stance. Mélenchon appeals to the party's base with his vision of a transformed France, but his polarizing style has drawn criticism even from within the coalition. \nOlivier Faure, the leader of the Socialist Party, represents a more moderate approach, emphasizing the need for a pragmatic strategy to address the challenges facing France.

Their commitment to social justice, inclusivity, and democratic values stands in stark contrast to the divisive rhetoric of the far-right. \n\nThe coalition's newfound momentum is further bolstered by effective communication strategies that highlight their candidates' grassroots connections and shared vision for a fairer society. Polls show a significant increase in support, with citizens flocking to their events, eager to engage and discuss pressing issues such as economic inequality, climate change, and immigration reform.

After years of political strife and social discontent, the government has put forth a referendum to establish the Sixth Republic. Citizens are torn between two visions: a moderate constitution designed to strengthen democratic institutions and ensure stability through gradual reforms, and a radical constitution that seeks to transform the political landscape with bold measures and enhanced direct democracy. \n\nSupporters of the moderate option argue that it offers a balanced approach, promising to address economic inequalities while preserving existing rights and fostering collaboration across the political spectrum. In contrast, advocates for the radical constitution assert that only sweeping changes can effectively tackle the deep-rooted issues plaguing the nation, despite the risks of potential unrest.

The atmosphere is tense, with deep-seated grievances and national pride at play. However, both sides are increasingly aware that continued fighting could destabilize the entire North African region, inviting international scrutiny and possible intervention. \n\nThe proposed treaty aims to address key issues: territorial disputes, refugee resettlement, and economic cooperation.

The destruction is unprecedented in scale as the explosion has obliterated almost everything from the front, inside, and the entirety of the roof with only the side and rear walls still standing. French law enforcement was fortunate enough to quickly cordoned off the area around Notre Dame and have so far found that the attack was conducted using a large but improvised car bomb. Islamist terrorists linked to ISIS in Western Africa have so far come out and claimed responsibility for the attack, citing the death of one of their commanders, Adnan Abu Walid al Sahrawi, as a major motivator. The French president has announced a state of emergency and the mobilization of all available law enforcement and National Guard units to secure Paris and other major cities. NATO and French intelligence and law enforcement agencies have announced a massive and expansive investigation effort to uncover any further plots and to apprehend those in country that could be linked to the attacks. France is now in a collective state of shock and mourning as an attack of this brazen nature and destruction only rivals that of 9/11 in the United States.

Accepting the deal could provide a much-needed boost to Venezuela's collapsing economy, allowing oil exports to Europe and offering temporary relief to a population struggling with shortages. However, it comes at the cost of ceding partial control of vital national resources to a foreign power - A move that some see as a surrender of sovereignty. \n\nThe government, already under pressure from internal dissent and facing international isolation, must now decide: accept France's offer and gain a lifeline for the economy, or refuse and maintain control over the nation's resources, hoping for a better deal in the future or the collapse of the embargo."

The proposal, known as FREXIT, marks a significant shift in France's political landscape and has ignited intense debates and discussions about the country's future relationship with the EU. The announcement of the FREXIT referendum has drawn mixed reactions from various segments of society. Supporters view it as an opportunity to assert France's sovereignty, regain control over economic and immigration policies, and protect national interests. They argue that leaving the EU would allow France to forge its own trade agreements, make independent decisions on key issues, and regain control over its borders. Opponents of the FREXIT referendum express concerns about the potential consequences of leaving the European Union. They emphasize the benefits of EU membership, including access to a single market, economic stability, and collaborative efforts to address global challenges."

The result of the FREXIT referendum has far-reaching implications for France and the European Union as a whole. It indicates that a significant portion of the French population values the benefits and opportunities provided by EU membership, including access to the single market, free movement of people, and collective decision-making on important issues. President Zemmour has yet to make any public appearance to acknowledge the victory for the EU, but is reportedly in the midst of launching multiple electoral lawsuits against his own government."

The decision to leave the EU poses significant implications for both France and the broader European Union. As one of the EU's founding members, France's departure raises questions about the bloc's cohesion, the future of integration efforts, and the stability of the eurozone.

 france.212.d: "In a shocking act of protest, demonstrators recently targeted the iconic ''Mona Lisa,'' draping the masterpiece in a layer of oil. This bold gesture aimed to highlight the urgent issues surrounding fossil fuels and environmental degradation, turning the world’s gaze towards the climate crisis. By choosing one of the most recognized paintings in history, the protesters sought to disrupt the complacency surrounding climate inaction, using the famed artwork as a powerful symbol of cultural heritage at risk. \n\nThe image of oil on the ''Mona Lisa'' struck a jarring contrast, juxtaposing the beauty of art with the stark reality of environmental harm. Protesters argued that such actions are necessary to provoke a response from a society often desensitized to the gradual destruction of the planet. They aimed to spark dialogue about the implications of our dependence on fossil fuels and the need for systemic change. Critics, however, decried the act as vandalism, questioning whether targeting art would truly inspire the needed action or alienate potential allies in the fight for climate justice."

This striking action was not just an assault on a beloved artwork; it was a deliberate statement aimed at drawing attention to the pressing issues of climate change and environmental degradation. By choosing such a high-profile piece, the protesters sought to provoke a conversation about the fragility of our natural world, as symbolized by the vibrant blooms that Van Gogh so beautifully captured. \n\nThe choice of soup, an everyday item, symbolized the urgency and accessibility of the climate crisis. While some criticized the act as vandalism, supporters argued that it was a necessary wake-up call. In a world where the beauty of nature is increasingly at risk, the juxtaposition of a masterpiece against the stark reality of environmental neglect underscored the need for immediate action. The visual impact of the soup on the painting served to remind us that the art we cherish is intimately connected to the very ecosystems that sustain life."

Renaissance will field 400 candidates, he added. \n\nThe reasoning behind the choice of name, Guerini said, was to show the party would ''always make the choice of enlightenment against obscurantism.'' It will be ''open to citizens, elected officials, local elected officials wherever they come from,'' he added. It was also the name given to the Macron's party list in the 2019 European election."

 france.216.d: "With the 7th Republic of France is poised for its first election, there has proven to be a stark contrast in ideologies among the major parties. The leaders of the Military's popular suspension of civilian government have supported Pierre de Villiers and his new ''Alliance for French Victory'' party, which presents a platform focused on bolstering national defense, advocating for a strong military presence in global affairs, and emphasizing the importance of a robust defense industry for economic growth and maintaining the glories of the military coup. \nIn contrast, the ''People's Democratic Union,'' led by Francois Bayrou has attempted to combine the ideals of Macron with other minor parties on the left, representing a broad centrist stance, aiming to balance military strength with social welfare and economic prosperity. They advocate for a pragmatic approach to governance, seeking to unite the nation under a banner of stability and progress. \n Finally, backed by the imprisoned Mélenchon and led by the former Prime Minister Eric Coquerel, the ''Progressive Renaissance Party.'' \n\nAs France stands at a crossroads, the outcome of this election will not only determine the future direction of the country but also reflect the deep divisions within French society regarding its second new constitution in a decade."

The election marks a significant moment in French history, as it will determine the direction of the country under this new constitution. \n\nThe ''Classic Party,'' led by former chairman and CEO of AXA, Henri de Castries, represents traditional liberal values of individual liberty, free markets, and limited government, is led by charismatic leaders promising economic growth and prosperity through deregulation and privatization. On the other hand, ''United for Change,'' advocates for social justice, equality, and government intervention to address societal issues. They promise to prioritize welfare programs, workers' rights, and environmental protection, appealing to those who seek a more inclusive and equitable society. \n\nThe outcome of this historic election will not only shape domestic policies but also determine France's stance on the global stage, highlighting the contrasting ideologies and values at the heart of the 6th Republic."

 france.218.d: "In the wake of the Russo-Ukrainian war and facing ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, France stands at a critical juncture regarding its constitution. The broadly Socialist leaning constitution of the 6th Republic, which emphasizes social welfare and democratic principles, is being questioned following the military's restoration of civilian administration following the war. \n\nProponents of maintaining the 6th Republic argue that it reflects France's values of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and provides a solid foundation for a democratic society. They believe that preserving this constitution is crucial for maintaining social cohesion and upholding the rights of all citizens. However, those in favor of a 7th Republic constitution argue that France needs a stronger, more centralized government with a focus on national security and military strength to navigate the complex and volatile international landscape. They believe that a more militaristic approach is necessary to ensure France's security and protect its interests on the world stage."

The French populace, still reeling from the effects of the Russo-Ukrainian war, has chosen to trust in the experienced leadership of the current government. With a renewed mandate, the government pledges to focus on rebuilding the nation, both physically and emotionally, after the war. \n\nThe landslide victory not only secures the government's position but also sends a clear message that the French people are united in their desire for stability and continuity during these challenging times. As France moves forward, the government is committed to honoring the sacrifices made during the war and building a brighter future for all citizens."

 france.220.d: "France's decision to enter the Russo-Ukrainian war has come at a great cost, with reports confirming the loss of 30,000 French soldiers in the conflict. This news has sent shockwaves across the nation, as families mourn the loss of their loved ones and communities grapple with the impact of the war on the homefront. The sacrifices made by these soldiers weigh heavily on the collective consciousness of the country, highlighting the harsh realities of warfare and the human toll it exacts. \n\nAs the war drags on, however, signs of war exhaustion are beginning to emerge within French society. The constant stream of casualties, coupled with the economic strain of supporting the war effort, has taken a toll on morale. Public sentiment is shifting, with growing calls for an end to the conflict and a focus on rebuilding and healing the nation. The loss of our soldiers serves as a sobering reminder of the cost of war and the toll it takes not just on the battlefield, but also on the hearts and minds of those left behind."

 france.221.d: "A coalition of German, Polish, and exiled Ukrainian military officers have recently come out with a document detailing the lack of French commitment to the European War, citing lax standards, constant retreats, and an unwillingness to stand against the Russian behemoth. This comes at the worst time, as the capitulation of the Ukrainian government has escalated the war drastically."

 france.223.t: "To my dearest Mère,"
 france.223.d: "Today, I have arrived at boot camp all the way in Paris and begun the first phase of Basic Training; they call it the ''Phase-jaune'', where I adapt to military life, learn discipline, teamwork, programs, traditions, and the like. While I have not found myself, anyone who I can call my comrade yet, I think I am going to be well acquainted with those who accompany me in training. I know you and Papa hate the city life, and always have, which is why you seemed hesitant at shipping me off here, it is not as bad as you think, I promise. It's in one of the more far-out arrondissements, I believe the twentieth and is not really part of the ''city life'', so to speak. Even now, I start to tear up knowing how long I will be gone. I already miss Papa, the farm, and brother Christophe; and I certainly know I will miss you. It's been hard work already and has really put me to the test physically. Of course, the lessons are always the easiest, for it's nothing I didn't already know. I think the discipline we have at the farm is really going to help me, so I thank you for that. At night, I've always dreamed of serving and fighting for my nation when it is endangered the most; to help other people and know what's best for your country is the greatest feeling in the world. In devotion to God, I will fight for my country valiantly and with the utmost honor. I hope not to be just a soldier for long, and have great aspirations. Maybe one day, I can become a military general and lead my people against the enemies of France! Hopefully soon enough. I wonder what the food is like in the military. Of course, nothing will compare to the meals you made every day during my childhood. I'm going to miss talking to you like this, and I will miss everything. But, that's what these letters are for, you know? I do hope you show these to Christophe and Papa as well. That would just warm my heart, as I love both of them with all my heart. \n\nSincèrement,"
 france.223.a: "Your son."
 france.224.t: "Salut Mère"
 france.224.d: "Today, I have been honorably discharged from the military so I can pursue a career within a Foreign Legion in America. I know this may frighten, worry, or anger you, as I have done it without your approval, but please know that I will be safe and that I am doing this for the good of my country and for those across the world. It has been 2 years since my first letter, back when I had just arrived at boot camp. Oh, I still remember that day; everything was so new, I met amazing people, only to have lost contact with them now. Their faces... they are like ghosts in my mind. I wish for their safety. I've told you all about this in my many visits, so I won't repeat it, but every day I feel like the world around me collapses. Like a fire that has been burning for years, engulfing the globe and slowly withering away at human culture, even our own. Some say it is just fearmongering, but I think it is a real threat. The result of the 2022 Elections have been disappointing to me, to say the least, and I grow more and more dissatisfied with the establishment every day. I know you do not like politics as much as I do, but you will soon learn that the ''state of politics'' is more important than anything else in the world. It intertwines with everything and anything. I know I will be even farther from home, far from Christophe, you, and Papa, which I do not want, this is completely necessary. Already, many of my comrades have volunteered to come with, and I have found myself a new brotherhood to exist in. Many of them are just like me and you; they have never been fond of city life, and want to see the best out of their country. If you have ever heard the story of Lafayette, it can be compared to what's currently going on right now. America is undergoing a revolution, and I will be at the forefront of it no matter who tries to persuade me. I dearly hope you perceive this letter in good faith, and I do love you with all of my heart. Please, just do not worry for me. I am grown, and I will be more than fine. \n\nSincèrement,"

 france.225.d: "Today, I have arrived in Bourdeaux after years of service in America. I am deeply sorry for not writing to you for all these years, but with the gravity of my situation there I simply did not have enough time. Christophe has written to me recently, telling me how devastated you were to hear about the news, and that you have worried for me profusely. Really, it must be so dreadful experiencing your own son going missing in a warzone. I have much to say, and when I visit you and Papa I will tell you everything I can't condense into this envelope. Christophe told me about Papa, and that his condition has been worsening. Please, please continue to update me on his status and the farm until I get home. If this is my last time seeing him alive, then I wish to not make haste in my journey home. My service on the frontlines in America has been eye-opening, to say the least, and has enlightened me on the true nature of war. I've always heard stories of insurgencies and conflicts, particularly from the veterans of the Légion étrangère, but have never actually experienced it until then. War is hell and destroys everything in its wrath. I have seen it all... the massacres and slaughters purported by those who claim to be fighting for the collective good. I do not wish to curse you with the details, as I know you are old, and wish to think of anything but that, but it is truly terrifying. It has really shown me how lucky we all are, when people who are our brothers are facing the horrors of war; civilian or soldier. I am sure you, Papa and Christophe have all heard the news; Russia is at war with Europe, and they will do whatever they can to raze our homes and villages. They have invaded Ukraine, and are destined to continue their expansion. I am re-entering the military, and I am going to serve my country and my people where it matters most. I love you dearly, Mère and Papa, and always will. \n\nSincèrement,"
 france.225.a: "Your son."
 france.226.t: "Dear Mère"
 france.226.d: "I write this letter to you with utmost fear and terror. This is nothing I have ever experienced before, not in America, not in my life. In America, I grew accustomed to victory, even if I saw my own comrades fall before me, and the crackling of rifles from as far as I could see, in every street corner, every house, and every shop. Here, in Ukraine, there is no such thing as victory. There is no glory. There is no life. We have no liberty. Everything and anything exists to serve slaughter and dishonor. Here, there is no chivalry, no knights to ride in and defeat evil. We do not face disorganized partisans, no, we face an Army of rapists and murderers, forced to put our lives on the line by bureaucrats who have never even seen a rifle outside of the television screen. I write to you, this message, from a foxhole in one of the many trenches surveying the frontline. These foxholes are my only resting area, even if I still worry of an artillery or drone strike sending me to God. In the trench line, there is mud over 3 feet tall, riddled with corpses, blood, and feces. It is the worst smell in the world, even worse to be in the middle of it, which you must. None of it is surveyed or kempt by our Commanding Officers. So many of my comrades, whom I've fought every where with, have been mercilessly slain in the line of duty, fighting this existential threat to our country. War is hell. I resist my urge to desert, for I know that fighting for my country, for you, for Christophe, and in the spirit of Papa, is my ultimate duty that I must serve. I have not eaten in 3 days, and I haven't drank water in 2 days. Supplies are dwindling fast, and we do not know when the next shipment will come. No Man's Land is nothing but a butcherhouse, where tanks get stuck in what the Russkies call the Rasputitsa, and destroyed. The relationship I have with my comrades means nothing. The teamwork exercises I've done in boot camp mean nothing. All my friends are murdered not even an hour after meeting them. I know how evil the Russians are, but I have been forced to kill teenagers. I have seen draftees, no older than 18-years-old, be torn to shreds by machine gun fire. Nobody else seems to mind it. We have grown used to it by this point. When this letter reaches you, I implore you not to worry. It's what you always do, and it saddens my heart. Know that I will be okay, and I will perservere. \n\nSincèrement,"

My brigade launched a particularly lavish celebration on Russian soil, with preparations being made to send us home. Russian resistance members began running to the opposite trench, greeting and hugging their family members who happened to be on the other side. Apparently, this has been deemed a victory by our Commanding Officers and the news at home; the Caucasus region, Belarus, and Belgorod have been liberated from Russian control with governments loyal to Europe being established. Of course, we have made no effort to overthrow the regime in Russia despite all they have done to harm our people, and it is likely to be destroyed from within. If we look at history, we can clearly see that a new government, far worse than the previous, will be born from the ashes of a burnt Russia, something that HICOM, and our government, does not care for. In the end, we have still won, right? I think this is an event that should be revered, but make no mistake, it is tragic. At what cost, have we pushed our eastern borders further? At what cost, have we unleashed the full might of the Russian bear? Knowing this, I just cannot, in good heart, return home as a hero. I am no hero. I am a bystander. I am no fighter, not until I take things into my new hands. The war has turned me into a new man, a new person. I will not be leaving Russia with my platoon, to the dismay of my brute of an Executive Officer. Please, do not worry for me. I am going to do what is best for you and Christophe. \n\nSincèrement,"

 france.228.d: "Today, we have received word that the war that has destroyed and taken so many lives, both from our country and beyond, has ended. There were no celebrations here in Warszawa, which the Russians have thoroughly destroyed and butchered. Every inch of this city is covered in rubble and corpses, with it resembling the state it was in when the Germans paraded through it 90 years ago. Every civilian who did not evacuate when the first wave came was ruthlessly slaughtered. Our supplies have long run out, and a good portion of our Army Group has perished due to starvation and the many diseases that run through our trenches. Those left within our Brigade are going home, a home tainted by the bureaucrats and war profiteers who have acted as parasites, getting rich while my comrades die in cities, having to endure the relentless assault of the Russians. They have done nothing to defend the heart and soul of the nation, and could not care less about the death of hundreds of thousands of French men. They are complicit, and if anything, collaborators with the Russians, actively aiding their massacres. I have nearly died dozens of times, and not one time did I get adequate medical treatment or aid that helped my position. Yet I still fought. I fought on and on, for years, only to be stabbed in the back by the people who call themselves leaders. We have lost this fight, and Russia has conquered Eastern Europe, flooding their borders and murdering Europeans. No longer, can I sit around, being ordered by my Executive Officers to stand in a trench on the frontlines. No longer, can I be a coward in my approach. I will act as a hero, I will act as a warrior for my nation and I will avenge my brothers who have fallen. I will return home and see through it that France will never fall as it did today, being subverted by Judeo-Communists both inside our nation and attacked by the Judeo-Communists in Russia. To my dearest Mère, know that I am going to do this for the good of my nation, for the good of you, and the good of Christophe. I love you with all of my heart. \n\nSincèrement,"

I am currently in the heart of the devil, Moscow, where I shall make my stand. I am entrenched with those who vowed to follow me on this mission, including several Russians, who know what is best for humanity. The politicians across Europe, who have sat entrenched in their palaces as our people are slain in the line of duty, with men as young as 18-years-old, being forced out of their homes, away from their family to fight for these politicians who have no respect for them. The Russians who have launched this war, invading their neighboring countries and acting as rapists, slaughterers, and murderers to the highest degree of barbarity. They have still gotten away with their crimes, being pardoned by the vermin that run the highest institutions in the world. Our people, our heritage, our ethnicity, and our culture, will forever be attacked and repressed by these rats hiding in Moscow, who are waiting for the perfect time to strike. You can already see their ideology being reborn, baptized through the blood of hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen. Whether it be the Nazis or Bolsheviks, they will never cease their assaults on our people. Through blood, shall I save my people and secure their future. I know that you are an old lady now, and wish to have peace, but you need to realize the truth. I am going to strike Russia from within, and if I succeed, I will march west, reclaiming Europe from the butcherers. A great revolution has begun, and as they say, a single spark can start a prairie fire. Please, dear Mère, if you receive this letter, spread the word. Do not let me be forgotten.

France has been saved from the yolk of the Liberal cosmopolitans and Judeo-Communists, who reduced our people as meatbags, sending us off to the east to be slaughtered in the butcherhouses which they set up. Despite your recent interest in politics, you have been getting old, and I wouldn't want your last days to be reading letters from your son about the state of French politics. I have used my position to ensure that your area was unscathed by the fighting, and that you would be in good hands. I am so sorry that I was unable to attend Christophe's 17th birthday, and I hope he does not feel any resentment towards me for it. When you hear about me on the television, or on your phone, just know that I do it all for your future. For Christophe, for everybody in France, and that is why I took it upon myself to carry out my duties with the utmost valor and honor, and I would not do it in anybody else's name. I remember the last time I saw you before heading off to boot camp all those years ago. Did you know, back then, that you have raised a national hero? You were the best mother any man could ask for. I am deeply sorry that I cannot visit frequently any more, as I must still serve, but you will forever be in my heart and spirit; so too will Papa, Christophe, and the entire nation. I think, that is where national harmony starts. It starts in the family, and the family is forever sacred. When I can visit you, I will do so, but unfortunately that time is not now. In the history of a nation, I believe that there is a clear, overarching story which establishes a national identity and heritage, fueling the warriors of said nation for millennia. The destiny of every person under the national flag is to serve it with valiance, or be part of social harmony. When you become grown, the deeds you will do to further this story outweigh your personal, worldly life, and that is reflected here. That is not to say that you are not apart of my mind, or that I have forgotten you, no, far from it. You have laid the building blocks, the foundations, for which I stand upon. I will always thank you for that. Of course, we can speak more in person, when that day comes. Goodbye for now, Mère."

This mandate has sparked heated debates across the nation, reflecting deep divisions over justice, morality, and the future of the revolution. \nCitizens are now faced with four distinct options for implementing state executions: \nThe Guillotine - A return to the iconic symbol of revolutionary justice, invoking the spirit of the past while aiming to serve as a deterrent against counter-revolutionaries. \nFiring Squad – A method that emphasizes swift and decisive action, appealing to those who prioritize efficiency and directness in matters of state security. \nLethal Injection – A more modern approach that advocates for a perceived sense of humane execution, aligning with those who argue for a less brutal method. \nAbolish the Death Penalty – A radical choice reflecting the ideals of mercy and rehabilitation, appealing to those who believe that the revolution should seek to transform society rather than perpetuate cycles of violence."

This debate not only highlights differing perspectives on tradition versus progress but also serves as a symbolic battleground for broader ideological conflicts. \nThe public is presented with two options: \nReturn of the Old French Republican Calendar – Advocates for this choice argue that reinstating the historic calendar will honor the revolutionary spirit and celebrate the values of the past. They believe it will unify the populace under a shared historical framework and emphasize the importance of revolutionary ideals in daily life. \nMaintain the Current Calendar – Supporters of this option contend that the existing calendar provides stability and continuity, allowing citizens to navigate their lives without the disruptions that a change might bring.

They argue that embracing these aspects of human identity is essential for fostering equality, promoting individual freedoms, and creating a more inclusive society. \nBanning Homosexuality and Discussions on Gender – Proponents of this choice argue that such measures are necessary to uphold traditional values and societal norms.

As the nation contemplates its relationship with symbols of past excess and decadence, citizens are invited to weigh in on the future of these monumental structures. This debate not only challenges the historical significance of these sites but also raises questions about the values that should define contemporary society. \nThe public is presented with three distinct options: \nMuseums of bourgeois Decadence – Proponents of this choice advocate for transforming these lavish estates into museums that critique their histories, highlighting the excesses of the bourgeoisie. They believe that by preserving these structures as educational spaces, society can learn from the past and foster a more egalitarian future. \nTear them down -  – Supporters of this option argue that these symbols of immense wealth are antithetical to revolutionary ideals and should be demolished to erase reminders of oppression and inequality. They contend that tearing them down would signify a definitive break from a past marked by class disparity. \nDo Nothing – Those in favor of maintaining the status quo believe that these architectural marvels are integral to France’s cultural heritage and tourism. They argue that preserving them as they are allows for appreciation of historical artistry and provides economic benefits to the community."
 france.234.a: "Convert them to Museums of the Bourgeois Decadence!"
 france.234.b: "Tear them down!"
 france.234.c: "We have more pressing matters..."
 france.235.t: "Revolutionary Mandate on Philosophy and Foreign Policy"
 france.235.d: "In a transformative moment for national ideology, a new mandate has emerged to shape the philosophical underpinnings of foreign policy. As the revolutionary government seeks to redefine its place in the world, citizens are invited to deliberate on the guiding principles that should direct their interactions on the global stage. This debate not only addresses national priorities but also reflects broader ideological commitments to revolutionary ideals. \nThe public is presented with two distinct options: \nWorldwide Revolution – Advocates for this approach argue that France should actively promote and support revolutionary movements across the globe. They believe that spreading revolutionary ideals is essential for dismantling oppressive regimes and fostering global equality. By positioning France as a champion of worldwide revolution, supporters contend that the nation can inspire change and solidarity among oppressed peoples everywhere. \nInternal Revolution – Supporters of this option argue for a focus on addressing issues within France before engaging with the international community. They believe that the government should prioritize internal reforms to ensure social justice, equality, and stability at home. By concentrating on the needs of the French people, proponents assert that the nation can serve as a model for others, demonstrating the effectiveness of revolutionary principles through tangible improvements in citizens' lives."
 france.235.a: "We will always stand for Revolution worldwide"
 france.235.b: "We must focus on our internal Revolution"
 france.236.t: "Revolutionary Mandate on the Law of Suspects"
 france.236.d: "In a moment of profound reflection on the balance between security and liberty, a new mandate has been introduced regarding the controversial Law of Suspects. As the revolutionary government grapples with threats to its stability and the safety of its ideals, citizens are invited to voice their opinions on the reintroduction of this significant legal framework. This debate stirs memories of past tensions and raises critical questions about civil rights in the name of security. \nThe public is presented with two distinct options: \nRestore the Law of Suspects – Proponents of this choice argue that reinstating the law is essential for safeguarding the revolution from internal threats and counter-revolutionary elements. They believe that the measures outlined in the law will enhance national security and preserve the hard-won gains of the revolutionary movement, even if it requires some sacrifices in personal freedoms. \nDo Not Restore the Law – Opponents of this option contend that reintroducing such a law undermines the very principles of liberty and justice that the revolution seeks to uphold. They argue that the law has historically led to abuses of power and unjust persecution, and that a commitment to human rights must be paramount in any revolutionary endeavor."
 france.236.a: "This is needed to maintain our Revolution"
 france.236.b: "This is Unwarrented Tyranny!"
 france.237.t: "Revolutionary Mandate on Robespierre and the ''Reign of Terror''"
 france.237.d: "In a pivotal moment of introspection, the revolutionary government has introduced a mandate to reassess the legacy of Maximilien Robespierre and the infamous ''Reign of Terror.'' As the nation grapples with its tumultuous history, citizens are called upon to evaluate the impact of Robespierre's actions on the revolutionary cause and the ideals it espouses. This debate serves as a critical examination of the balance between revolutionary zeal and the principles of justice and humanity. \nThe public is presented with two distinct options: \nBeacon of Revolutionary Idealism – Supporters of this perspective view Robespierre as a champion of the revolution, whose unwavering commitment to revolutionary ideals justified the measures taken during the Reign of Terror. They argue that his actions were necessary to protect the revolution from enemies and maintain the hard-won gains of liberty and equality. Advocates believe that recognizing Robespierre as a guiding light is essential for inspiring future generations to uphold the revolutionary spirit. \nTyrant - Opponents of this view contend that Robespierre’s reign represented a dangerous overreach of power that led to widespread fear, repression, and the loss of countless lives. They argue that labeling him a petty tyrant serves as a warning against the dangers of extremism and the potential for revolutionary fervor to devolve into authoritarianism. This perspective calls for a critical reevaluation of the past, emphasizing the need to prioritize justice and human rights over the pursuit of ideological purity."
 france.237.a: "He was a Beacon of Revolutionary Idealism"
 france.237.b: "He was nothing but a Petty Tyrant"
 france.240.t: "The Military uses their Influence"
 france.240.d: "In recent days, it has become an open secret that the French military is subtly exercising its influence over political affairs, shaping national policy from behind the scenes. While official channels remain quiet on the matter, military leaders are increasingly seen as key players in the decision-making process, leveraging their considerable resources and public support to advocate for a more assertive defense strategy. This has raised eyebrows among political analysts and citizens alike, who are beginning to question the true extent of military involvement in governance. \n\nAs tensions in the geopolitical landscape grow, whispers of military preferences for a hardline approach to foreign policy have circulated among government circles."
 france.240.a: "What do they wish to achieve?"
 france.241.t: "Reshape the French Citizen"
 france.241.d: "With our victory in the elections, our party has been given free command to enact reforms, including the plan to reshape the idea of the French citizen. However, this has become a polarizing problem in our government with 2 sides supporting alternative ideas. The moderates of our party believe we should encourage our citizens to serve their country by enlisting in the army. While France has long enjoyed relative peace in the 21st century, recent developments in America and Europe have necessitated increasing defense spending. \n \n   The hardliners of our party, however, argue that we should encourage our citizens to serve their country by seeking employment in factories. With the outbreak of war in Saudi Arabia and America tethering on the brink of a certain civil war, France must bolster its domestic production if it hopes to survive. This proposal has faced opposition from both moderates and environmentalists within our party, who argue that telling our people to work themselves to the bone will only work to damage our approval rating. Regardless, the party hardliners support this idea as a way to stimulate the growth of France's economy."
 france.241.a: "Embrace Service to Your Country"
 france.241.b: "Hard Work Pays Off"
 france.242.t: "French Republic requests lower Reparations"
 france.242.d: "In the aftermath of our decisive victory in the recent conflict, we have received an official request from the French Republic to lower the war reparations imposed upon them. This appeal serves as a clear indication of France’s weakened state and its acknowledgment of our strength on the international stage. As we reflect on our triumph, it is evident that this request symbolizes not only France’s vulnerability but also our position as a formidable power in Europe."
 france.242.a: "We shall, but they must accept payback our lost assets"
 france.242.b: "It would insult the fallen!"
 france.244.t: "Melenchon Consolidates Power!"
 france.244.d: "Jean-Luc Mélenchon has successfully consolidated his authority within his faction of the New Popular Front, positioning himself as the dominant voice in the party amid a shifting political landscape. Through a series of strategic alliances and effective communication, Mélenchon has rallied his supporters, reinforcing a vision that emphasizes progressive policies and social justice. His charismatic leadership style has resonated with the party base, allowing him to consolidate power and push forward an ambitious agenda."
 france.244.a: "Cool"
 france.245.t: "Faure Consolidates Power!"
 france.245.d: "In a strategic move to strengthen his position, Olivier Faure has successfully consolidated power within his faction of the New Popular Front. As the political landscape becomes increasingly turbulent, Faure's leadership style has resonated with party members, who view him as a unifying figure capable of navigating the complexities of contemporary politics. His efforts to bring together various ideological strands within the faction have resulted in increased cohesion, allowing for a more focused agenda that appeals to a broader electorate."
 france.245.a: "Cool"
 france.251.t: "Mélenchon is flying to Moscow"
 france.251.d: "In a bold and provocative statement, Jean-Luc Mélenchon asserted that ''Russia is a friend of France with whom cooperation should be increased,'' advocating for a shift in foreign policy amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and NATO's potential involvement. He expressed concerns about NATO's escalating military presence, declaring, ''Very soon, processes will be launched to withdraw from NATO.'' This declaration aims to reposition France as an independent actor in international relations, focusing on diplomacy and collaboration with nations that share common interests, rather than aligning with military alliances. \n\nSince Mélenchon’s announcement, the military has remained notably quiet, raising questions about the internal dynamics within France’s defense establishment. This silence may indicate a reluctant acknowledgment of the political shift underway, as the military navigates its role in a changing geopolitical landscape. Mélenchon’s emphasis on cooperation with Russia and a potential withdrawal from NATO resonates with segments of the electorate weary of conflict, positioning the New Popular Front as a key player advocating for a new diplomatic approach in Europe."
 france.251.a: "Cool"
 france.252.t: "Mélenchon opposes the war"
 france.252.d: "Today, French President Jean-Luc Mélenchon addressed the nation, expressing profound concern over the escalating conflict involving a Medvedev-led Russia and the potential entry of NATO into the fray. ''Dear fellow citizens, I stand before you today with deep concern in my heart,'' he stated, urging the French people to refuse involvement in a war with Russia. ''We are being urged to engage in a conflict with Russia, but I tell you this is madness. This is not our war. This is not our battle.'' Mélenchon emphasized that France must not be drawn into an endless cycle of violence, advocating for a withdrawal from NATO and a return to an independent policy focused on peace and stability. \n\nn his passionate address, Mélenchon invoked historical context by asking, ''Why die for Odessa?'' This echoed the famous phrase ''Why die for Danzig?'' highlighting his strong opposition to military confrontation and framing the current situation as one that does not warrant French sacrifice. By rallying the nation around a message of non-involvement and diplomacy, he seeks to steer France away from escalating tensions and towards a path that prioritizes dialogue and cooperation over conflict."
 france.252.a: "Cool"
 france.253.t: "Mélenchon calls for Unity against Fascism"
 france.253.d: "''Citizens of France and of all Europe! Today we are facing a huge threat. The fascist Russian Empire, led by Vladimir Zhirinovsky, has launched an aggression against Ukraine. We cannot stand by. We, as a democratic Europe, must unite and fight back against this evil. Fascism has no right to exist in the modern world. We must unite all our forces, all our resources to confront this threat. Today, I call on all French citizens, all our allies in Europe and beyond: let us stand shoulder to shoulder against fascist aggression! Our future depends on our determination. We will fight for freedom, for democracy, for the future of our children. Forward, to victory over fascism!''"

 france.254.d: "President Jean-Luc Mélenchon announced the creation of a brigade of Russian radical anti-fascists and communists under the command of Sergei Udaltsov. This brigade is intended to fight against the fascist Russian Empire and its leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, symbolizing international solidarity and the struggle for justice."

 france.146.d: "To Whom It May Concern, \n\nAs the tides of nationalism rise within our great nation, it is my duty to express my growing concern over the current government's inability to address the pressing needs of our people. The time has come for military leadership to step forward and guide our country toward strength and stability. Our influence can no longer be sidelined; we must assert our presence to ensure that the interests of France are protected. It is imperative that we stifle any efforts by the ruling government that jeopardize our national integrity. \n\nSigned, [THIS.GetRank] [THIS.GetName]"

 france.147.t: "Military hands us the Bill"
 france.147.d: "To the Ministry of Finance, \n\nIn light of recent developments, I have taken the liberty of reallocating substantial government funds for military operations deemed essential for national security. While these expenditures are vital for maintaining our preparedness, it is essential that the ruling government understands the gravity of the situation.

However, we must remain resolute in our posturing. By openly challenging the government's decisions, we highlight our commitment to the true needs of our nation. While this may cause instability, it is a necessary step to demonstrate that the military stands as a formidable force in the face of poor governance. The people must see that we are prepared to protect their interests. \n\nSigned, [THIS.GetRank] [THIS.GetName]"

 france.149.d: "To the Command, \n\nI am pleased to announce the formation of a new division dedicated to the ideals of nationalism that resonate with our people. This division will operate under the principles that prioritize the welfare of France and its citizens, independent of the current government’s influence. It is crucial that we establish a force that reflects the aspirations of the populace, as our loyalty now lies with the nation itself, rather than the individuals currently in power. We must prepare for the challenges ahead. \n\nIn service to our nation, [THIS.GetRank] [THIS.GetName]"
 france.149.a: "Well, this isn't too bad"
 france.250.t: "A New Candidate?"
 france.250.d: "As the upcoming presidential election looms, a power struggle has emerged within the National Front following Marine Le Pen's public statement against the military's control in the government. The French military, increasingly concerned about the direction of the party under Marine Le Pen, has quietly but firmly demanded that the FN replace her with a candidate more aligned with their interests: Pierre de Villiers, the highly respected former Chief of the General Staff. De Villiers, known for his strong pro-military stance and no-nonsense approach to defense, represents a sharp departure from Le Pen's populist rhetoric. \n\nThe FN leadership is now torn. While Le Pen has cultivated a loyal following, there is growing recognition that a more pro-military candidate like de Villiers could attract the support of key military figures and conservative voters who see national security as paramount. The military's intervention, though informal, is a clear signal that they expect a shift in policy and personnel at the highest levels of government. The party must now choose between staying loyal to its populist base or embracing a figure who could deliver both electoral success and military backing."
 france.250.a: "Three Cheers Villiers!"
 france.250.b: "We stan Le Pen!"
 france.262.t: "France offers NATO Membership for Guiana"
 france.262.d: "In a surprising diplomatic maneuver, the French government has offered to cede French Guiana to Brazil in exchange for the country's membership in NATO. This bold proposal aims to strengthen the alliance in South America and enhance regional security against external threats. France believes that integrating Brazil into NATO will bolster collective defense capabilities and promote stability in a geopolitically strategic area. \n\nThe French leadership envisions this arrangement as mutually beneficial: Brazil would gain a significant territorial asset, enhancing its influence and resources, while France would secure a powerful ally within NATO’s ranks. However, this proposal has sparked intense debate both domestically and internationally. Critics question the long-term implications of such a territorial concession, while supporters argue that it could usher in a new era of cooperation and security in the region. As discussions progress, the world watches closely to see how this unprecedented offer unfolds."
 france.262.a: "Yea Sure"
 france.262.b: "Fuck You!"
 france.263.t: "Brazil Accepts!"
 france.263.d: "In a historic turn of events, Brazil has officially accepted France’s offer to cede French Guiana in exchange for its membership in NATO. This agreement marks a significant milestone in Franco-Brazilian relations and is viewed as a strategic move to enhance security and stability in South America. The French government sees this as an opportunity to solidify alliances in the region, leveraging Brazil’s emerging influence within NATO to address collective security concerns. \n\nAs the transfer of Guiana unfolds, France is focused on ensuring a smooth transition for the territory and its residents. The French leadership is committed to upholding the rights and welfare of the local population while integrating them into Brazil's governance. This bold decision is expected to foster closer ties between the two nations, promoting economic cooperation and shared security interests. While some critics express concerns over the long-term implications of this territorial shift, the government remains optimistic that this move will strengthen NATO's presence in the Americas and contribute to a more stable regional landscape."
 france.263.a: "Excellent!"
 france.264.t: "Brazil Refuses!"
 france.264.d: "In a surprising turn of events, Brazil has officially rejected France’s offer to cede French Guiana in exchange for NATO membership. This decision has left the French government frustrated, as it had hoped to strengthen alliances in South America and enhance regional security through this unprecedented agreement. French leaders view Brazil’s refusal as a missed opportunity to solidify a powerful partnership within NATO, which could have addressed mutual security concerns more effectively. \n\nThe rejection has sparked intense debate within France about the future of its strategic interests in the region. Some officials express disappointment, arguing that Brazil’s refusal signals a reluctance to engage more deeply with NATO and the West. As the government reassesses its diplomatic approach, there is a renewed focus on strengthening ties with other potential allies in Latin America. France remains committed to maintaining its presence in the region, but the path forward will require careful navigation of complex geopolitical dynamics and a re-evaluation of its foreign policy strategies."
 france.264.a: "Well fuck you too!"
 france.265.t: "Quebec holds Independence Referendum"
 france.265.d: "As tensions rise in Quebec, the provincial government has officially announced an independence referendum, seeking to determine the future of its relationship with Canada. This significant political move reflects long-standing desires for greater autonomy and self-determination among many Quebecois. The Canadian government views this referendum as a critical moment that could reshape the nation, and leaders in Ottawa are urging for a strong campaign to highlight the benefits of remaining united. \n\nIn response, the federal government has ramped up efforts to engage with Quebec citizens, emphasizing the economic, cultural, and social ties that bind the province to Canada. Prime Minister and cabinet officials are preparing to launch a nationwide campaign, aiming to present a compelling case for unity and the potential consequences of independence. As the referendum date approaches, both sides are gearing up for a contentious debate that will have lasting implications for the future of Canada."
 france.265.a: "We out"
 france.265.b: "We like Canada actually"
 france.270.t: "France demands More War Reperations"
 france.270.d: "In the aftermath of the devastating conflict with Russia, the French government has taken a bold step by formally demanding increased war reparations. With our nation suffering extensive damage and loss, the leadership is determined to hold Russia accountable for its aggressive actions. The French Foreign Minister has stated, ''We must ensure that those who instigate such conflicts bear the consequences of their actions. The sacrifices of our people must not be forgotten, and justice must be served.'' \n\nAs France pushes for these reparations, the response from Russia is uncertain. This demand could lead to heightened diplomatic tensions, potentially straining relations within NATO. Alternatively, a more peaceful approach may open avenues for negotiation, allowing both nations to seek a resolution and foster stability in Europe. The path forward will significantly impact the balance of power in the region."
 france.270.a: "We out of MONEY"
 france.270.b: "We will scrounge what we have"
 france.271.t: "Russia Denies Increased Reperations"
 france.271.d: "In response to the recent demands for war reparations, the Russian government has categorically denied France’s request, claiming it to be an unjust imposition. This denial has further fueled tensions between the two nations, as France views it as a blatant disregard for the suffering endured during the conflict. The French leadership, determined to uphold national dignity and secure compensation for the losses incurred, perceives this refusal as a clear indication of Russia's unwillingness to take responsibility for its actions. \n\nIn light of Russia's rejection, France has decided to impose an economic embargo, aimed at exerting pressure on the Russian government to reconsider its stance. This move is intended not only to signal France’s commitment to justice but also to rally international support against Russian aggression. The French government believes that an embargo could effectively challenge Russia’s defiance and force a reconsideration of its policies, while also reinforcing the unity and resolve of NATO allies in the face of ongoing threats."
 france.271.a: "They know our response"
 france.272.t: "Russia Accepts Increased Reperations"
 france.272.d: "After intense negotiations and mounting pressure from the international community, the Russian government has unexpectedly accepted France's demands for war reparations. This decision is seen as a significant victory for the French leadership, who view it as a crucial step toward justice and accountability for the suffering endured during the recent conflict. The acceptance not only acknowledges the hardships faced by France but also signals a potential thaw in relations, providing an opportunity for renewed dialogue. \n\nIn light of this development, France is poised to take steps to rebuild and strengthen its economy, utilizing the reparations to support recovery efforts and reinforce national stability. This positive outcome may also enhance France's standing within NATO, demonstrating its ability to hold adversaries accountable. However, the French government remains cautious, aware that continued vigilance is necessary to ensure that Russia adheres to its commitments and that future conflicts can be avoided."
 france.272.a: "Oh Cool, thanks!"
 france.273.t: "French Government demands Leniency"
 france.273.d: "In light of the ongoing situation in our occupied territories, the French government has formally requested that we exercise leniency in our governance of these zones. France argues that a more humane and accommodating approach will foster stability and facilitate the return of normalcy, potentially paving the way for future reconciliation efforts. \n\nFrench officials emphasize that treating local populations with respect and understanding could help diminish hostility and encourage cooperation, especially as we work to rebuild our nation after the recent conflict. However, there are differing opinions within our government regarding the practicality and implications of this request."

This demand has ignited intense debate within our government and society, as the battalion has been a crucial force in our defense against Russian aggression. \n\nSome argue that complying could improve our standing with Western nations and promote democratic values, while others warn that disbanding a unit that has demonstrated significant courage on the battlefield will weaken our national defense."

 france.284.d: "Over the desert flies a French transport helicopter, the blinding Saharan sun has set for the time being sparing its inhabitants from the unrelenting heat only to let in cold temperatures. \nHenri clutched his rifle, looking out over the expanse, lost in the droning of the rotors. \n\nThey were approaching the insertion point, a small oasis in the desert creeped up on the horizon, a village on no one's map nestled within the few savannah trees. Supposedly here resides a weapons stockpile that's been supplying some Islamist rebels or so they told Henri, it's all a bunch of political stuff above his office. The helicopter lands and distant yelling comes from within the building, obviously they've been heard. \n\nMoving quickly they form into squads, clearing building by building, waking up families dressed in rags in poorly furnished homes, crying children, gunfire in one of the houses and the French fire in return, and in the basement they have found the stockpile. A boy hugs tightly the man who they shot, Henri takes up rear security, watching the door as inventory is taken, they seized 1,823 Kalashnikov rifles and over 84,000 rounds of ammunition. It was a major bust, but was it worth this kids father?"
 france.284.a: "These are the questions that keep Henri up at night."
 france.285.t: "And They Live On"
 france.285.d: "Ibezimako Chinwendu was born in 1988 to an Igbo family in Amaeke, Southern Nigeria, living a life one could only describe as pure tragedy. He grew up with scarce access to clean drinking water or even proper meals, attributed to the federal government's lack of effort, and lack of care, to fund and re-integrate communities like his nestled within the war-torn south of the country. This led him to detest the greedy and remarkably corrupt military elite that policed him, his friends, and above all else, his family. He found solace in the comfort of Islam, the martyrs that defined entire eras because of their ambition and struggle for their faith. This was a travesty, a complete betrayal of the principles those above claimed to follow and worship. Things had to change.\n\nAnd so, they did. He was now 33, no longer suffering in the rural south of his home country. The seeds of entropy planted 20 years ago had long begun to take root, suffocating the essence of his spirit and only allowing a passion for hate to breathe through. To those who had known him, he was unrecognizable now, covered in ISWAP insignia below the signature black bandana that had become infamous across not only the Middle East and Africa, but the world. He was perched upon a steep hill, overlooking a French military base just outside of Bula Bul.\n\nHe was there for one reason only, to give his life for Islam.\n\nHe had sat there, upon that hill, between Dalbergia branches and the wind that covered his entire body. He held his beating heart as he thought things over for a moment. He was terrified. Deep in his heart, he knew he didn't want to do this. But he also knew that he had to. This was the culmination of everything he had fought for, the chance to finally make a name for himself amongst the shahids before him. Had they, such as Sumayya and Yasir RA, been just as afraid in their final moments? Possibly, possibly not. It would not matter in the end, when they stood before The Creator in the afterlife. Only their actions did. \n\nAnd so, he descended the hill towards the lights illuminating him, gripping his vest as he dove into the unknown for one last time."
 france.285.a: "Tafsir Surah Ali 'Imran - 169"
 france.286.t: "A Flat Circle"
 france.286.d: "Its been months since the proposed tax hike on gas had sparked a protest across France. Rural members of society have felt alienated by the upper classes of France, alienated urban voters who envisioned a better future for France. By all accounts, its a tale as old as time in France. \n\n''The protests have been going on for ages. The government is just as deaf as its always been. Sending its lackeys to defend the status quo. More must be done to give the people a voice!'' Barked a burly man from the working class rural areas. Rain soaked clothes from hours of rallying people and driving tractors through the streets of Paris blockading police called in to squash the protests. His contemporaries from all walks of life from all ends of the political spectrum nod in agreement but some of the more moderate members look on in disapproval, fearing the ramifications of such a move. \nA man steps forward with a counter argument; ''The people already are growing tired. Any further actions would lead to losing the public support and will of the people. They are tired, losing hope, and getting arrested in droves. If we take any further moves, it could spill over into full blown chaos with people getting hurt. We must keep to peaceful means and look after our optics. Popular marches of peaceful protest with the people on our side will force the government to back down. If we keep pressing harder, the government will have the justification to quell our movement and drive people to support such a move just for a return to normalcy.'' \nThe words of the man resonated with some. Understanding that the balance of power in balancing the spirit of revolution and the masses wishes for a peaceful life even if it means giving up the hard fought efforts that they had already made. It was difficult to live life already under Macron's policies, adding protests and instability across the country would only make things more difficult for the common man. It would put strain on an already weakening system that while flawed, kept the social contract in place. The discussions fluttered around the idea of full blown rebellion against the state and a more peaceful unified voice of the people directed to those within office to hear. Varied views were discussed and accepted suggestions if it meant establishing the 42 demands laid out by the movement."

 france.292.t: "Eurasianism of the West"
 france.292.d: "''Rodolphe Prudhomme, please take the stand.'' announced a Les Identitaires party clerk standing on the podium. \n\nRodolphe Prudhomme was a respected and senior member of the Bloc, having done well to spread the growth of the movement in his home city of Bordeaux for years. Today, he would lead the opening session of a meetup in the Talence Commune, the gathering area situated just outside of a public park. It would be a good way to attract both negative and positive attention, as well as defining the movement's strategy in the region for the yearly quarter to come. \nAfter his name was called, Rodolphe stepped upon the podium, giving his regards to the clerk, and began to speak. The rigor and tenacity in which he spoke, despite his age, was one of the many reasons for his meteoric rise in the party. He spoke with the enthusiasm of the revolutionaries and martyrs of the 20th century that fought before him, contrasted with his wisdom and insight that the new generation after him would need. The crowd cheered him on as he spoke of the influx of Turkish, Maghrebi, and Sub-saharian migrants in Grand Parc who had become a majority. \nEventually, he concluded his speech, passing the stage to Léon Duverger, a much younger and inexperienced member of the party. This was a deliberate decision, meant to symbolize a ''passing of the torch'' of sorts between the old and young. What he did not know was how widely Léon was mocked for his inconsistent and sometimes comical belief system, as well as his rather unpleasant vocabulary.\nIn spite of his comrade's disparagement, Léon took the stage, beginning his speech.\n\n''Friends and brothers, I would like to start off by responding to Monsieur Prudhomme's strategy in the Gironde Department. With no disrespect to the great man himself, how can the Eurasianism of the West achieve its goal if it-'' \n\nThe man was interrupted by a cacophony of laughter and boo'ing, attributed to his ill choice of words. He tried to continue speaking, however he was laughed off the podium, and eventually out of the Party, as a result of this very strange speech."

General Schill gives a wide smile and takes his seat. \nSchill knows Hanouna is a comedian, meant to make the crowd and the nation laugh, and inviting an army official on your show means you must have some funny things to say, the general smiles uneasily as Hanouna begins to speak. \n\nAt first it's normal, but it shifts towards Frances allies, and eventually the focus settles on Germany. ''What about the Bundeswehr?'' Schill asks. ''Well, it's small don't you think? Hah!''

The Queen is against the idea, citing that the cause of our dispair has been mismanagement by French officials, started by the unpopular forced abdication of her father by French-backed Prime Minister Laurent Brogniet."

You see, I believe that placing too much emphasis on individual liberties can lead to a neglect of social responsibilities. We must consider the greater good and the well-being of the entire community.\nMICHEL MARCHAND: Ah, but that is precisely where we differ! The Rights of Man, in my perspective, prioritize the individual as the ultimate unit of society. By safeguarding the rights and freedoms of each person, we empower them to contribute to the collective progress and prosperity. It is through the flourishing of individuals that society as a whole can thrive.\nD'ARAMITZ: While I appreciate the importance of individual empowerment, we must also acknowledge that societies are complex and interdependent. The Rights of Man should encompass not only individual liberties but also responsibilities towards the community and the environment. The well-being of the collective cannot be compromised for the sake of individual autonomy.\n\n click to continue..."

Bonaparte is a unfortunately a lifelong liberal, but despite having the last name of Napoleon, he has pledged his loyalty to King Louis and abandoned his lineage.

His lineage as a member of the House of Orléans, coupled with his remarkable intellect, unwavering dedication to our nation, and his genuine compassion for the people, make him the ideal candidate to lead us in these tumultuous times. Jean possesses the charisma and wisdom needed to restore stability and unite our fractured country. His vision for a more egalitarian society, where the rights and well-being of every citizen are upheld, resonates deeply with me and many others who yearn for a just and prosperous France.\nIn an era marred by political strife and disillusionment, Jean d'Orléans offers a beacon of hope. His progressive ideas and commitment to reforming outdated systems have the potential to usher in a new era of prosperity and social harmony. Moreover, his experience as a diplomat and his extensive knowledge of international affairs equip him with the skills necessary to navigate the complex web of geopolitics. By embracing Jean as our king, we not only honor our historical legacy but also embrace a future where fairness, compassion, and progress can flourish. Let us come together, set aside our differences, and rally behind Jean d'Orléans as we embark on a journey towards a brighter future for France and all its citizens.''"

To the Bonapartists of the 21st century, class conflict and struggle are responsible for the decline of the formerly grand Western societies. The remedy for this chaos can only be found under the rule of a single leader, a national patriarch who can wield the power of the state to crush the enemies of the masses. Bonapartists are also distinguished by their strong identification with the Latin peoples of Western and Southern Europe. They see themselves as the inheritors of the legacy of not only the First French Empire, given their name, but also of Rome. The most radical want for the entire Latin world to be united under a nationalist, authoritarian state."
