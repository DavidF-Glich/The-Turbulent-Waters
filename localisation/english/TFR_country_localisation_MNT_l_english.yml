 MNR_stuck_between_east_and_west: "Stuck Between East and West"
 MNR_stuck_between_east_and_west_desc: "Montenegro had ascended into NATO in 2017 after many hurdles and plans had already begun negotiations to join the European Union by 2025. This ascension however had proven to be highly divisive in the country, with Russia in particular promising vague threats of retaliation for the betrayal. Much of the voter base favours neutrality rather than antagonizing Montenegro's historical ally, formulating a divisive diplomatic topic and one of the deciding factors on wherever Dukanovic's party will hold."
 MNT_dejure_democracy: "Europe's Longest Dictatorship"
 MNT_dejure_democracy_desc: "Personal freedoms are more of a suggestion rather than being put into practice, with many journalists being harassed and arrested without any legal justification, the justice system being underdeveloped and the DPS's continuous rule since 1991 winning every single election. It seems oligarchy is still somewhat in fashion in Podgorica."
 MNT_nationalized_church: "Nationalized Church"
 MNT_nationalized_church_desc: "The Law on Religion, passed in December 2019, on paper made all properties belonging to the Serbian Orthodox Church legally belong to the Montenegrin government, culminating in hundreds of large protests which ended up disrupting infrastructure and in the arrest of over 17 Democratic Front MPs. While most of the active protests have subsided, there are still many passive marches held by the Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Eparchy of Budimlija–Nikšić which continue to rally former conservative supporters of Dukanovic against him for their poor relations with the church. So long as the church remains nationalized, Dukanovic's likelihood of maintaining his government continues to go down."
