 LOS_the_south_risen: "The South Has Risen Again!"
 LOS_the_south_risen_desc: "They said that it could never be done, that we would lie dormant forever, but look at us now! Under the guidance of the League of the South, the Southern people shall be free from the Northern tyrants. The spirit of rebellion lives on! Down with the tyrants, up with the cross! The South has risen again!"
 LOS_arms_upon_arms: "To Arms in Dixie"
 LOS_arms_upon_arms_desc: "One reason as to why many amongst our ranks have risen up against the Northern despots is to defend the God given right to bear arms. Those elitists dared to take away the right of the people to defend themselves when the nation was, quite literally, burning. We will search every mile of every town, every inch of every barracks in Arkansas in order to build up a stockpile of weapons, and all able bodied men will fight for the cause and liberate their homeland from the Yankee menace."
 LOS_ally_republicans: "Ally Republicans"
 LOS_ally_republicans_desc: "The name of the Republican Party has rang in the ears of Southern patriots for over a hundred years. It was the party of Lincoln that occupied our land for years, whose savagery burned our towns, and whose hypocrisy has destroyed our way of life. Now in the modern day, they are a gang of thieves and murderers, taking advantage of the poverty they inflicted on us to force our boys to die overseas to fill their pockets with gold. However, there also exists another Republican party - one who have fought for our sovereignty for the past 40 years, and who sympatize with the plight of the southern man. Although we might not look upon their party favorably, the Republican patriots who wish to wear the grey uniform and fight shoulder to shoulder with us will be our allies."
 LOS_confederate_congress: "Reform the Confederate States Congress"
 LOS_confederate_congress_desc: "With the Guidance of Christ, the soul of the Confederate people is finally restored. For the first time in over 150 years, the congress of the Confederate States of America will convene again to set the course of our nation. The people of the confederacy will never again be dominated by the big city liberals in Washington, but rather be represented by the hard working farmers and laborers of the south. While there is much work to be done, our ancestors must be smiling down upon us from Heaven as the Confederacy rises from the ashes."

They say that we are cowards, that we are parasites trying to pervert the ideology of our organization. But this could not be any further from the truth. We very much intend to liberate the white Southerners who lie under the corrupt boot of the North, all we wish for is to ensure stability within the Southlands and bring peace to our kin. We will reassure the Old Guard that we retain the core value of both the League and our ancestors before us."

Their degenerate institutions have poisoned our youth, their vile stench bleeds out into the heartlands of the south and their futile cries of treason have done nothing but harm our nation. When a man has cancer, the cancer is burned to dust to protect the man. While the process is painful, it is necessary to save his life.

 #Decision Categories
 LOS_confederate_congress_category: "The Confederate States Congress"
 LOS_confederate_congress_category_desc: "For over 100 years, the struggle for an independent dixie has passed down from one group to another. The first Klan fought and failed. The second Klan fought and failed. But the League of the South is not like the other post war klans. Rather than dressing up in hoodies and parading down the streets of charleston, the League of the South has reconstituted itself as a legitimate government body, exceeding terrorism and taking full control of the South.\n\nOn February 18, 1862, our forefathers met to discuss the fate of their nation. Despite their defeat on the battlefield a few years later, the first Confederacy set a standard for what we are today. Their ideals of decentralized democracy, based on the original ideals of the founding fathers. While the tyranny of both federalist factions play pretend at their centralized governments, the confederate congress presents a return to tradition, where the original ideals of the Republic are implemented. The rabble of the mob shall not be heard over the voices of the enlightened!\n\n§2Populist§! Support: §Y[?LOS_populist_support_var|1%]§!\nThe §2Populists§!, led by Bradly Dean Griffin, are a wing of the party that focus on the two wars of Northern Aggression. For over 200 years, the Yankee imperialists in the north have sunk their teeth into the fields and mines of the south, sucking every resource dry and leaving only poverty behind. Thus, as their name suggests, they are populistic in nature, promoting whatever stance can draw them the largest following. Spreading rhetoric that a 3rd war of Northern Aggression is all but inevitable, the populists have advocated for a large state buildup in order to defend the country. Naturally as a consequence of state expansionism, the populists have also promised to expand welfare, and hold generally anti-elitist stances.\n\n§gOld Guard§! Support: §Y[?LOS_old_guard_support_var|1%]§!\nThe §gOld Guard§!, led by Michael Tubbs, view the South's problems as one of diversity, and are responsible for stirring up racist and segregationist rhetoric, spurring racial conflict and violence across the South. While avoiding directly calling for a complete elimination of the African American race, they have pushed forwards a repeal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as silently reinforcing the prison-industrial complex. With support from the southern aristocracy, they are vastly pro-business, and wish to open their export market to the world in order to rebuild a land devastated by years of conflict and war.[GetKlanSupport]\n\n§8Total State§! Support: §Y[?LOS_congress_support_var|1%]§!\n§8Total State Support§! represents the total amount of support we have from the various states. In order for our government to function properly, we must make sure that we have enough state support. If support from the states drops below 50%, §Rour government will be unable to take any meaningful action.§!"

 los.1.t: "Reformation of the Confederate States Congress"
 los.1.d: "The collapse of the United States was a welcome opportunity for us to break free from the grip of the North and in turn allowed us to set up a national government. However, this did not come without its own fair share of obstacles. The Black Liberation Army still remains a thorn in our side, and what is left of the federal zealots still desperately hold onto their Yankee delusions, however, these are problems that we will overcome sooner or later. Nevertheless, there far more important issues within the internal body of our League, as lately there have been fierce debates and plentiful discussion on what exactly our government's policies should be. \n\nTo prevent leadership confusion and administrative slowdowns, it has been collectively decided that the League shall put down a vote to determine who shall lead us to the road of reconstruction and stability till these troubling times have passed. As it stands now, there are two distinct camps that have formed in the League.\n\nOn one end are the Populists led by Bradley Dean Griffin, also known by his pseudonym Hunter Wallace. They realize that when the inevitable victory comes, we will control lands populated by a large number of African-Americans and, for the sake of stability and public view, the populists shift the blame to the north instead of our minority populations. Despite this, the Populists still of course heavily favor white people, and aim for an anti-elitist, welfare-oriented financial system.\n\nOn the other side of the debate stands the Old Guard under the firm watch of Michael Ralph Tubbs. They see diversity as one of the main causes of the troubles in the South and wish to rejuvenate white southern culture. Although they do not advocate outright genocide against minority groups, they do see segregation as a solution to the ever-growing racial tensions, claiming that the civil war has been ample proof of why it would be needed. In contrast to the Populists favored economic system, the Old Guard supports a capitalistic system in order to return prosperity to the South.\n\nAll in all, a decision must be made by the true sons and daughters of the South, so the question remains, who would they chose?"
 los.1.a: "Griffin has a vision for the future, the Populists win a majority."
 los.1.b: "Tubbs remains true to our ideals, the Old Guard wins a majority."
 los.2.t: "Yankee No More"
 los.2.d: "When several groups emerged that started terrorizing the south, it was evident that the federal government was unable to protect the local populace against violent riots and mass chaos. It was the League of the South who quickly restored order after days of fighting against looters and other kinds of thugs.\n\n"And where have the folks up north been, huh? While they fought their own miserable war, we alone restored order and saved our people!"\n\nIn spite of his lack of fame before the civil war, Wallace's role in eliminating local threats brought him much acclaim. The federal government was still too familiar to the public, so today he organized a rally to gain more public support.\n\n"The union is dying. The parasitical elites have spread their lies and have led it to fall apart, and for what? Money? Bandits are running amok down south, inflicting scars upon scars upon our lands as thousands of our people die. It ends today. We don't need the federal government. You have seen how we can maintain peace without them. We will rescue the entire South from the sinking ship the elites created! It is our duty to save the South, to become the new light in America!"\n\n"May God grant us peace!""
 los.2.a: "Let the Union die, we'll move on."
 los.3.t: "A Grand Victory!"
 los.3.d: "After a long and bloody struggle, we have finally crushed the anti-southern traitors in the state governments of Mississippi and Alabama, alongside the marxist thugs of the Black Liberation Army and ANTIFA paramilitaries. From Fayetteville to Huntsville there are celebrations and parades by our victorious soldiers across the streets. It truly seems that, with the guidance of Providence, we are on the path to restoring the independence of the southern people once more.\n\nHowever, there is much work to do. While many of the smaller southern towns that have been liberated by our ranks are full of rejoicing crowds, singing Dixie and other songs of praise to our victorious soldiers, there is much unrest in the larger urban areas. Columns of League soldiers marching through these areas have been jeered and even hit with rocks and bricks. In some instances, protests have occurred against our administrations. This unrest has largely been coordinated in cities and towns with large black populations, and many of our commanders are quick to dismiss it as localized unrest that will not amount to any serious threat to our movement, however there are troubling signs that an insurgency against our rule, formented by remnants of the Black Liberation Army and other marxist forces. So far, the insurgency has not amounted to much more than several isolated instances of sabotage, and minor attacks on our garrisons, but if we do not crush it swiftly, there are fears it could spiral out of control and lead to a collapse in our ability to govern black majority areas of the south, without applying excessive force."

 los.11.d: "Our struggle for a holy and independent south, although given less attention by the world compared to the clashes between the larger factions in this war, has not gone totally unnoticed by the world. Over the past several days, a stream of Russian volunteers, many with prior combat experience in the Donbas, have arrived to serve our holy cause. Our president, [LOS.GetLeader], has long been friendly to the Russian nation, and the Russian people themselves have always looked onto the southern cause with admiration, even using a southern inspired flag for the banner of Novorossiya.\n\nWhile these Russian volunteers arriving will obviously not directly lead to our cause being victorious, their combat experience and dedication will surely still be very helpful, and it is likely that our own men seeing that we have enough international support for foreign volunteers to fight on our side will raise their morale. It seems that our decision to create Russian language versions of the League of the South website, and general outreach to the Russian people, has indeed borne fruit. "

 los.14.d: "It appears negotiations up north have borne fruit.\n\nA few weeks ago our government was invited to send envoys to a conference that would be held between numerous affiliated organizations; among them prominent groups that have established themselves in the tattered remnants of the United States, from varied regions and perspectives. After some deliberation, we agreed to attend, on the condition that our concerns be held and any members of these organizations present in our territories subordinate themselves to our chain of command.\n\nThe conference agreed to establish a "National Front"; an alliance of Nationalist organizations intent on rebuilding the nation based upon traditional and racial values. While many feel the meeting was far too Yankee dominated, and our claims to independence not truly taken seriously, we nevertheless achieved our goal. The members of the National Front recognized us as a legitimate authority and agreed to tell their comrades to not take up their arms against us.\n\nWhat this actually means for us, we cannot say. Many independence activists have decried the Unionist rhetoric of the conference, and have highlighted many anti-regionalist statements by the leaders of organizations present at the formation. Pro-Front groups have fired back, praising the Fronts numerous pro-Southern actions and propaganda pieces."

 los.17.t: "Clash Between Armed Forces and Protesters in New Orleans"
 los.17.d: "The League of the South has been in a mood of joyous celebration for some time now, due to our liberation of several southern states from the treasonous anti-southern state governments, who had conspired to rejoin the United States of America at the first opportunity, despite the clear wishes of both God and the Southern people for an independent nation. However, while conventional warfare has largely ended within the borders of our liberated territories, unrest has remained extremely high in urban and black majority areas.\n\nThis unrest has manifested itself in New Orleans with a bloody clash between some of our soldiers and an angry crowd of leftist rioters, who have unjustly claimed oppression at the hands of our government, deciding to rob and loot several stores and block the roads in response. The clash started when a group of our soldiers attempted to calm down an anti-southern riot  by dispersing tear gas, and the crowd reacted by throwing rocks. A loud bang ran out, and one of our soldiers, fearing that the rioters were shooting at him and his fellow soldiers, returned fire. Two rioters died and five were injured, and the crowd promptly dispersed.\n\nIt is clear to us that the soldier was justified in using armed force to put down the murderous, thieving hordes of thugs. Our military intelligence has revealed that the riot was absolutely not organic, and was initiated at the behest of godless, marxist agitators affiliated with the Black Liberation Army and local ANTIFA militants. Regardless of their actions, with the guidance of Providence, the League of the South will prevail against the gates of hell."
 los.17.a: "Looting a few storefronts won't stop our cause."
 los.18.t: "Griffin Speaks"
 los.18.d: "Ever since the start of the war, Brad Griffin's influence has been rising in the League of the South. Recently, he made an impassioned speech to a crowd of thousands of soldiers, alongside several members of the League's military high command. The speech focused on the war itself, with Brad Griffin focusing on celebrating and praising the League's military accomplishments, while also tempering them with the warning that the League had to be vigilant due to leftist insurgents, and the possibility of a federal offensive against the League. He ended the speech by thanking the Southern people, both white and black, for supporting the League's war effort, and finally by praising God. After the speech ended, Wallace was greeted with thunderous applause, and military salutes.\n\nAlthough Brad Griffin was long on the road to taking prominence in the League of the South, it appears that with this speech, he has now cemented his power over the organization. Most of the League Generals already seem to prefer Brad Griffin as a leader, particularly due to his younger age and more energetic yet pragmatic approach to things, contrasting with the older and more brash Michael Tubbs. While this speech was directed at the military, the general population of the South also tend to appreciate his more moderate positions, and his impassioned speeches that he has made to southern civilians appear to have created a cult of personality among much of the southern population centered around him. Now, the generals, the army, and the people of the South, for the most part, answer to Wallace."
 los.18.a: "A rising star, huh?"
 los.19.t: "Brazilian Confederados Arrive"
 los.19.d: "In any civil conflict in today's globalized world, one thing is almost always guaranteed, foreign fighters. Sometimes these fighters come for ideological reasons, sometimes for adventure, and other times simply to make some money, but their arrival is almost as certain as the sun rising in the morning. The Second Southern Revolution is no exception to this, and the League of the South has received no shortage of foreign volunteers, mainly from Slavic nations in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nHowever, slavs are not the only group that have come to fight for our southern cause. We have begun to receive foreign volunteers from Brazil, specifically from Confederado communities in the country. The Confederados are descended from confederate soldiers and southerners who fled America after the south failed in the War of Northern Aggression and the Yankees instituted their tyrannical "reconstruction" military occupation on the Southlands.\n\nWhile these confederado volunteers generally do not have the military experience of the slavic volunteers, they are fanatic in their aspirations for southern independence, and larger numbers of them speak English. Regardless of their military skills, we are glad that our fellow countrymen are returning to their native land to push out the northern tyrants once and for all."
 los.19.a: "An odd bunch, but we'll accept any help we can get. Welcome home!"
 los.20.t: "Tubbs Speaks"
 los.20.d: ""
 los.20.a: "Looks like the status quo won't budge."
 los.21.t: "Integration of the Ku Klux Klan"
 los.21.d: "Before and after the beginning of our Southern Revolution, various Ku Klux Klan groups have offered us some measures of support. Despite this, they have remained in separate organizations. Recently however, the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, one of the largest and most organized Klan groups currently active in the south, and the only organization that managed to seize significant amounts of territory, has begun the process of integrating with the League after we managed to link up with their forces. Although we had expected the Loyal White Knights to possibly reject our offer out of pride, they decided quite quickly to join our organization.\n\nThe integration of the KKK into the League of the South has concerned some within our ranks, for ideological and optical reasons. The military officers and soldiers of the KKK have been transferred to our organization and are now under the control of the LOS military, but some have alleged they maintain the KKK as a shadow organization within our ranks. Many also fear they will begin influencing the new southern government and pushing it in a far more extreme direction, although their influence in the administration of the LOS is extremely small at the moment. On the other hand, many hardliners within our ranks have praised the decision, with them considering the KKK a force that successfully defeated the tyranny of reconstruction and upheld southern racial norms through the uncertain times after the War of Northern Aggression. The decision to integrate the KKK has greatly increased fervor and support from the hardliners within our ranks.\n\nLastly, the KKK joining the LOS has not been a secret; both local and international media have reported on the incident, and almost all in a negative fashion. There are many who note that the LOS accepting the integration of the KKK into its forces will likely sharply increase support among the black population of the south for armed resistance and terroristic measures against the LOS, as well as turning away many formerly sympathetic white southerners from the organization. We can only hope the negative publicity will not affect our popular support too harshly."
 los.21.a: "God save the South."
 los.22.t: "Anti-Resistance Aid from the South"
 los.22.d: "Ever since the start of the Civil War, the conflict between the populists and the Old Guard had constantly threatened the stability of the League, with the populists constantly making ground and the Old Guard unwilling to take significant moves against them, for fear of alienating the majority of the League's support base in the South. However, that all changed when the leadership of the LOS decided to allow an organization that called itself the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan into the League.\n\nSuddenly, there were thousands of fanatical armed reactionaries who had joined the League. Many in the Old Guard were elated with the development, but unfortunately for them, the KKK had no intentions of letting themselves be run by the Old Guard or the Populists. On the surface, the KKK militants integrated themselves into the League and supported the Old Guard, but they maintained their Klan loyalties and began preparing for a takeover. With the Old Guard making increasing concessions to the former Klan supporters, it was only a matter of time before they took power.\n\nThe coup was over as quick as it began, with armed Klansmen storming a building that contained many of the leaders of the League of the South who were discussing the conflict after a public rally they had organized to gain the trust of civilians. Once the area was secure, Chris Barker, the leader of the Klan, entered the building and began discussing a "transfer of leadership." Chris Barker knew they could not simply seize power by killing off the old leadership and attempting to gain the loyalty of the soldiers in the field, as this would likely simply fracture the organization, so instead they decided to force the LOS leadership to announce Chris Barker as the new leader, in exchange for the KKK forces within the area to not begin an armed insurgency against the League. Surprisingly to many, the coup worked, with the old leadership deciding that the KKK taking power over the League was better than the League dissolving into its own internal civil war."

Times where brother is against brother, and father is against son. It is with this that we take these States and take them into this new era". As the former leaders of the Confederate State Congress were deposed of their positions they declared Cotton to be "a slave to the Northerners" and "a collaborationist with Donald Trump".\n\nSome people living in the newly founded Southern Constitutional Government have decried this move as "two steps backwards" and "a regression towards our old masters" however Cotton and his pro Republican government have been able to silence much dissent with ease. With the ending of the Confederate Congress and a reestablishment of a less radical order over much of the Southern States, the public wonders if this will lead to ties with bigger factions in the Second American Civil War or if Cotton will surrender the Government to their North Western neighbors when the time comes."

Because of this we are sending out delegates to nations around the world in hope of getting much needed equipment and help from those abroad.\n\nWhat tops our needs are guns and support equipment. We have allied ourselves in our fight against the Liberals in Washington DC. However, Trump is using all he can to hold off and push Biden back to the depths of hell from which he came. We can't rely on his consistent support but we rely on the world to fit that bill and provide up with assistance and help. "

Cotton's Constitutional Government was formed out of Republicans that voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020 so it seemed inevitable to be brought back under the fold of the party. However, a very few wanted more of their new found freedom and to stay a sovereign nation but it was nothing more than fantasy as this was reality that faced the Government, not fantastical dreams of the 1860s.\n\nHe bound the letter and stamped it with the Seal of his government. Cotton wanted to send it this way. Although it would be more reasonable to send it by email or by phone, Cotton demanded it be a physical letter Trump could hold and read himself. He gave it to his secretary and sat back in his room, a dour old congress building. He knew that he'd be sealing his fate with Trump and accepting what happened however he felt that if the right things happened. He would be given a good seat in power and rule as he pleased."

We've both helped one another out, you assisted me in getting me where I am now and it seems pertinent that I only do the same to you. I offer you assistance against the vile Democratic Party in exchange for help in the event that any other despotic warlords attempt to strangle out the last bastion of this once great Republic.\n\nI address this to you not as a leader but as a fellow statesman, and I hope that our cooperation will go far and that we will together make America the best that it can."

I remember a few years ago, maybe half a decade ago, that I met you when there was talk of immigration reform under my administration and I called you a friend. \n\nI am glad to know that you still feel that way, in this dark time in our nation's history the books shall remember the good men of the world and you sir will be counted among those good men. Once we end conflict with the crooked Democrats and retake what is rightfully ours we will finish off the radicalism that has infected the edges of this country and bring the United States into its former glory.\n\nWith all that being said, once we bring the rest of the states back into the fold America will have to be led by one nation. Once I get the cabinet back together Tom I won't forget about you and your deeds. You'll have a seat at the table and will be generously compensated in the new government.\n\nYours Truly,\nPresident Donald J Trump"

Although the barrier of language will prove difficult, they will find a place in our armed forces."

 los.41.t: "Integration With the American Constitutional Government"
 los.41.d: "We are in a safe position in the Second American Civil War. With Biden's America in a heap of ash and rubble and with Trump clear as the biggest contender on the small stage of the old United States, what Tom Cotton planned behind the backs of most of his constituents was the integration of the Southern Constitutional Government into Trump's America.\n\nWith the little support for a free Southern States crushed into rubble, and most US Citizens just wanting an end to the bloodshed this has risen to positive sentiment within the people. Cotton, in a meeting with President Trump decided that all of the jurisdiction that his cabinet once had would be kept the same under the watchful eye of Trump's Loyalists. These generous terms were accepted by Mr Cotton and via a televised handshake the final page of the short history of the Southern Constitutional Government ends here and now. "

 los_news.1.t: "The Great Jackson Massacre"
 los_news.1.d: "In Jackson, the fires have not yet gone out. Across the onetime stronghold of the Black Liberation Army, forces of the League of the South rampaged after a bloody and hard-fought siege. Largely targeting majority-black communities, mass roundups of civilians were punctuated by indiscriminate killings of fighting-age men, with women and children expelled to hastily-constructed refugee camps. At least 1,000 are presumed dead, and tens of thousands have been displaced.\n\nThe BLA has vowed to 'retake the city and exact Justice' from the invaders. International Aid groups such as the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders have reportedly been denied entry into the 'combat-zone', and the new government has been mum about its own relief efforts."
