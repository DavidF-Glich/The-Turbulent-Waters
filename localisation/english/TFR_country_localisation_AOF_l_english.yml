In opposition to the Anarchist ways of the G.M.A.C, many towns have pledged loyalty to the Sons of Liberty, a large militia group fighting for Libertarian values based largely out of New Hampshire.  \n\nThe representatives are sent to vote on legislature put forward by any town, but with the consolidation of power between the two groups, the divides within the Association grow ever more present, and the political neutrality of small towns are being ever questioned by larger forces."
