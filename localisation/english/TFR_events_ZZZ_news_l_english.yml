 news.3.t: "Former US President Jimmy Carter Passed Away"
 news.3.d: "In South Georgia, the United States, there is a stubborn turtle that will never go around any obstacle it encounters during its movement, but will keep pushing forward until it pushes the obstacle away. Some colleagues of former US President Jimmy Carter often called him the "South Georgia Turtle", and the joke in the past unexpectedly became a vivid portrayal of Carter's legendary life for a hundred years. \nAs the "last idealist president", Carter practiced his idealism almost stubbornly during his short four-year presidency, but his ruling career faltered and ended miserably. He is an "outsider" in Washington, the first politician to declare that he "never lies", and some people say that he is the last moderate president of the United States. \nBut in the second half of his life, after leaving the White House, Carter's vitality unexpectedly released a dazzling light. This idealist used the half century after leaving office to practice his beliefs and finally won the respect of the world. He is the "worst" president of the United States, but the "best" former president. \nOn December 29, local time, the Carter Center of the United States issued a statement saying that Carter died at his home in Georgia, southeastern United States, at the age of 100. This centenarian experienced the world wars, the Cold War, and the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and witnessed the vicissitudes of the world before passing away. \nThe man is gone, and this "good man president" remembered by the world finally passed away at the age of 100, leaving the world with only the firm but lonely back of the "idealist"."

 news.4.t: "US Reaches Peace with Taliban"
 news.4.d: "After eighteen months of war, this Saturday, the United States envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representative Abdul Ghani Baradar signed a historic peace agreement in Doha, Qatar, after the two sides spent months discussing the details. \n\nUnder the terms of the agreed agreement, the United States pledged to withdraw all troops and all auxiliary personnel, including allies, within seven months. The United States will reduce its troop numbers to 5,000 in the first 100 days and withdraw related troops from five bases, and the rest of the troops will be withdrawn in the following months. At the same time, as a gesture of goodwill, the Afghan government will also release up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for 1,000 Afghan security forces held by the Taliban. The Taliban has agreed to stop supporting groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. However, given their previous historical origins, many people question whether the Taliban can fulfill their promises until the end of the agreement. \n\nIn this nearly eighteen-year war, the US government is expected to spend about $1 trillion on the treasury and more than 2,400 American citizens have died. Despite a surge in troop numbers in recent years, U.S. and Afghan forces have been locked in a deadlock in their fight with the Taliban.\n\nThe Afghan government will also begin talks with the Taliban to plan a political solution and determine the Taliban's future role in Afghanistan. Those talks are expected to begin next month, with the primary goal of achieving a long-term ceasefire in Afghanistan."

 news.6.d: "On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black American, was killed by a 44-year-old white police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis. Floyd was arrested for allegedly using a counterfeit $20 bill after being reported by a store cashier. Chauvin continued to kneel on Floyd's neck for more than 9 minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down on the street. Two other police officers, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, assisted Chauvin in subduing Floyd. Lane also pointed a gun at Floyd's head before Floyd was handcuffed. A fourth police officer, Tau So, prevented bystanders from intervening. \nBefore being placed on the ground, Floyd showed signs of anxiety, complaining of claustrophobia and being unable to breathe. After being subdued, he became more anxious and still complained of difficulty breathing, a knee on his neck, and fear of impending death. After a few minutes, Floyd stopped talking. He was motionless in his final minutes, and Kuhn found no pulse when asked to check. Despite this, Chavin ignored pleas from bystanders to lift his knee off Floyd's neck. The next day, the Minneapolis Police Department fired all four officers after witnesses and security camera footage were released. Two autopsies and an autopsy review found Floyd's death to be a homicide.\nAfter Floyd's unlawful killing, the Black Lives Matter movement quickly rose and again marched across the United States against racial injustice."

 news.7.t: "Biden Wins US Presidential Election"
 news.7.d: "With little surprise, Joseph R. Biden was projected as the winner of the U.S. presidential election and the new leader of the country. Many senior political commentators and scholars believe that Trump's defeat is almost inevitable, pointing out the large number of obstacles he needs to overcome. However, the Trump campaign has strongly opposed this and questioned the results of the election, alleging voting irregularities and other related issues. \n\nIn addition to the Trump campaign, many senior members of the Republican Party have also expressed concerns about large-scale voter fraud. Although doubts about the election are everywhere, congressional staff have announced that the irregularities raised by the Trump campaign are inconsistent with what they found during the counting process. It can be seen that the political disputes that have plagued the United States during the election season will not be calmed down in the short term."

 news.8.t: "Trump Wins US Presidential Election"
 news.8.d: "An unexpected event shocked the entire United States: Donald Trump won the presidential election. Previously, many political science experts had predicted that Trump would lose the election, especially due to many pressing issues in American society. However, Trump seemed to break many predictions and won the election against the trend. \n\nInterestingly, the Biden campaign team strongly opposed this result and questioned the legitimacy of the election results, alleging voting anomalies and other related issues. At the same time, the Democratic Party and other political liberal organizations have joined hands with Biden to condemn Trump's political goals for the next government. However, despite the constant questioning of the election results, congressional staff said that during the counting process, their findings did not support the abnormal allegations made by the Biden team. In any case, it is foreseeable that the political disputes throughout the election season will not be calmed down soon, and the divisions in American society will continue for some time."
