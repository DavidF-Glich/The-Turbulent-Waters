 NSM_overwhelming_factionalism_idea: "Overwhelming Factionalism"
 NSM_overwhelming_factionalism_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_NSM_fractured_movement\n\n\n\n\n\nEver since 1945, when the walls came in on Hitler and snuffed out his light, National Socialism has lacked a definitive mindset. It has seemingly become free for anyone to mold into whatever suits their opinions on matters of race, religion, and all the other things the cause holds close to its heart. Factionalism within our ranks has only grown thanks to our party swelling with thousands of new faces, all looking for a beacon of hope in this sinking ship formerly known as the United States of America.\n\nHowever, with this fast growth, it was impossible to induct all card-carrying members, making it inevitable they'd choose which one of our many divisive demagogues they would hold up as a pillar of the ideology. We must find the will to root out this problem before it destroys our ability to liberate all worthy men from the chains of this decaying and dying world. Our only true hope is to follow down one of two paths, that being either in the footsteps of Hitler and rip apart the degeneracy that is the current American system or that of Rockwell, which, although still drastic, would only require a shift within the American culture, may whatever path we choose to lead us to the final victory!"
 NSM_fractured_movement_idea: "Fractured Movement"
 NSM_fractured_movement_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_NSM_fractured_movement\n\n\n\n\n\ncould be worse"
 NSM_infighting_militias_idea: "Infighting Militias"
 NSM_infighting_militias_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_NSM_militia_infighting\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a new opportunity jumping out at us, we have found ourselves at war once more. This time, we will not allow bickering to drag us down. Although our armed forces are nowhere near the prowess or size of the Wehrmacht, we must build towards it, and the first step towards this glorious goal must be disciplining the ragtag militias fighting underneath our banner. As of the moment, all these thugs in rags do is charge mindlessly at the enemy, drive away possible recruits and worst of all, contribute to the factionalism, even turning friendly gatherings into scenes right out of the Beer Hall Putsch, this must come to an end for the sake of the greater good."
 NSM_our_cause_idea: "Our Cause"
 NSM_our_cause_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_NSM_our_cause\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is not a shock to anyone that our cause, our struggle, our fight has never been very popular, especially in America, the heart of all financial woes of the world. Even now, though our numbers are dwindling and our influence over politics is non-existent, even the least radical of our members make the average American slam their door shut. Yet, despite this hostility, we still have a chance to overcome the almost century-old stigma against National Socialism. To do this, we must become America's salvation and demonstrate that the hated ideology can coexist with the American way of life if this strategy works, the potential for national reunification and even liberation beyond the old borders of America remains limitless."
 NSM_rustbelt_industry_idea: "Rustbelt Industry"
 NSM_rustbelt_industry_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_banner_NSM_rust_belt_industry\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat was considered the industrial powerhouse of the United States is now nothing more than a nickname commenting on its depressive state. Following a sharp decrease in industrial work in the late 1970's the region saw most of its factories slowly become abandoned and decrepit. With the economic fallout of the United States before the civil war the situation in the Rust Belt rapidly became even worse than it was before. Now with the National Socialist Movement residing in the heart of this region it's safe to say that many reforms and investments will need to be made in order to bring this industrial powerhouse out of hibernation."

 NSM_our_cause_dynamic: "Our Cause"
 NSM_our_cause_dynamic_desc: "The last few decades have not been very kind to National Socialism in America, to say the least.\n\nDespite our recent surge in popularity and media attention thanks to the crimes, incompetency, and tribalistic degeneracy of the elites running our country being exposed for the world to see, we are not the National Socialists of old, championed by visionaries such as Rockwell or Pierce. Our support is limited, and many of those who are loyal remain apathetic; they are unwilling to leave their family and homes behind to kill their brothers, much to our dismay. Petty factionalism within our ranks has also been on a steady uptick ever since the arrival of fresh recruits from across the country, with it poised to destroy our movement from the inside. We must take immediate action to cleanse our movement from these reactionary elements, lest we are defeated in the same manner our German counterparts were eighty years ago."

After all, the Social Darwinism of the market weeds out the undermench and paved the way for the übermench of the next generation. Of course, this market must be carefully regulated so history does not repeat itself, to ensure that the white man has his chance at prosperity, rather than having to face the uncountable barriers that face them in pre-war America. Nevertheless, the money will flow, and once again unleashed from the chains of the Marxist Corporations, prosperity will once again return to America."

 ## 6 - Events
 
 nsm.1.t: "The Movement's Direction"
 nsm.1.desc: "With the outbreak of hostilities, we have found ourselves in control of a sizable chunk of territory, even if it's miniscule in comparison to the rest of the country. With this, Burt Colucci's top advisors have suggested seeing to the path our movement will take when governing our controlled regions. As a result of our vague home policy, something of a divide has begun to form within the movement between the so-called "hardliners" led by one Paul Mullet, and those dubbed "reformists" by the recently-returned former leader of the movement, Jeff Schoep.\n\nSchoep's views of "reforming" the movement largely reside in the treatment and viewing of non-aryans in regards to the largely bickered-over racial hierarchy that many in the NSM choose to follow. The reformists advocate for alternatives to those considered non-aryans, rather than the outright direct action against them as proposed by many hardliners. Economically, the reformists also seek a more capitalist-esque economy with considerable portions of government intervention for "the benefit of the common American". Many of our newer additions as well as a notable portion of older members have aligned themselves with Schoep, citing both his experience and the need for reform if we are to ever attain stability after our victory. Many regard Schoep with suspicion, however, due to denunciation of the movement upon his stepping down from leadership before the war, with much of this ire coming from the hardliners and even some skeptical reformists.\n\nIn opposition to Schoep lies Paul Mullet, a vocal supporter of the Christian Identity sect of the movement and the definitive figurehead for the hardliners. Considered by some to be the most authentic supporter of the movement's values, Mullet has placed an emphasis on order, the family unit, and American nationalism - seeing these things as being wrought with decadence as a result of non-aryans and their ideals as if they were a "disease" according to Mullet. Advocating for a corporatist planned economy in line with national socialist ideals, the rejuvenation of Christianity throughout the United States in order to cure the populace of decadent morals, and more direct methods against the non-aryan population (of which are yet to be specified). Many older, more Christian members of the movement, as well as a portion of the newer membership have aligned themselves with Mullet's stances, viewing them to be aligned with "true national socialism". Mullet's explicit stance on religion however has seemingly ruffled some feathers in the movement, with such a topic seeing a wide array of opinions on both ends.\n\nWith both Schoep and Mullet having Colucci's ear, it is up to Colucci alone to determine who exactly has set the reliable course for the movement."
 nsm.1.a: "Schoep is right - we've got to appeal to the population, or else we'll never win them over!"
 nsm.1.b: "Mullet has the right idea; better to solidify our stances than to sink back into degeneracy!"
 nsm.2.t: "Special Forces Group Establishes"
 nsm.2.desc: "Burt Colucci examined the men before him and felt nothing but the highest admiration. Did any better example of the Aryan Race exist anywhere in all the world? Burt thought not.\n\nThe men before him were the inaugurating members of the new Wiking unit, and what men they were. They had pristine Aryan features, they were tall,  had thick blonde hair,  had gleaming blue eyes, had bold features, and had bodies hardened by combat. They had been chosen for the racial characteristics first and their combat abilities second, and while the latter were certainly impressive, the former were outstanding.\n\nIt was only right that such men be outfitted in similarly appealing uniforms, they were in the garb of a Waffen-SS unit, and looked as if they had marched right out of WW2.  They were clothed top to bottom in jet black, thoroughly decorated in nazi insignia and a familiar red armband found a place at their side. In their arms lay rifles, some of which Burt was told were used by original Waffen-SS units, though he couldn't really tell if that were true or not. \n\nThey left him with a salute and he looked over them warmly as they marched off, determined to further the goals of race and nation."
 nsm.2.a: "Lets see how they do."
 nsm.3.t: "Detroit Gangs Liquidated"
 nsm.3.d: "As our campaign through Michigan continues, today we have scored an important victory; Detroit, which had been controlled by a series of black gangs since federal authority collapsed over the city has been cleared out by our forces. The national socialist flag has been hoisted over city hall, and we have already observed a massive exodus of non-aryan civilians from the city, especially across the river into Canada. Our forces took a few potshots at the fleeing civilians, and we plan to blow up the ambassador bridge to stop this mass migration. As for the enemy itself, Black gangsters were slaughtered and defeated in several decisive street battles by our forces,  and an assault on their main headquarters found an empty room, implying that their leaders are most likely gone.

 nsm.4.d: "The anger in Grand Rapids reached its crescendo today, with riots erupting in the city which currently lies in the hands of the American "National Socialist Movement". The situation in the city had been tense for some time, with the Proto-Government being extremely unpopular among the locals, who previously had been strongly in support of the state's militia, whose remnants has been organizing resistance in the region.\n\nFootage released this morning of demonstrators burning the flag of the National Socialist Movement and of attacks on buildings used by the de-facto government. Chants of "Down with Colucci!" reportedly could be heard throughout the city. This seemingly is the greatest resistance against American Nazism at this point, however, if the movement is not stopped it is expected to spread throughout the state, giving way to the possibility that America's stint with Nazism will be quashed in its infancy.\n\nExpectantly, the response from authorities has been brutal. NSM state forces were reported to have consistently used excessive force, attacking all who were present, regardless of if they had made any threat, had been violent, were members of the press, or even if they were part of demonstrations at all. The scale of protests led to state forces deploying tear gas to the extent to where it could be smelled from inside buildings throughout the city. In footage taken by one protester, state forces could be seen beating demonstrators with batons and rifle butts, before detaining them.\n\nIt remains to be seen how the situation will develop. As of this point, demonstrators seem undeterred by the violent tactics employed by State Forces, and the American Nazis are a peril they have never before been faced with."

Protesters were cleared from the center of the city and officials have announced that the city has largely been peaceful since.\n\nFootage was released earlier today that showed the brutal crackdown by state forces as they cleared an intersection of demonstrators, arresting many and beating even more with clubs and rifle buts.\n\nThe Neo-Nazi government has also arrested leaders of the movement, charging them for "disturbing public order" and said that the move was "necessary to secure order in the state" As of now the safety of many of these organizers is in question, and it is unlikely that we will know their whereabouts for certain until the end of the war.\n\nCommander Colucci made a statement commending the police for their conduct saying \"The police have done their job well, those rioters were there to bring cultural marxism to this nation, and while their actions may be seen by some as harsh, they were necessary to secure this nation for the white race."\nAs of now, the streets have gone silent. It is unknown if the movement will make a resurgence later on, but as of now, we can only hope for the best."

 nsm.6.d: "This morning, nearly 2000 paramilitary forces belonging to the American "National Socialist Movement" retook the center of Grand Rapids, Michigan, which had been the center of an Anti-Fascist protest movement in their territory. Scores of unarmed demonstrators were killed, and the current death toll is unknown. \n\nTroops blocked out every escape route for demonstrators, and moved into the mass of protestors, firing directly into the crowd. Many who were not a part of protests, and were simply in the area during the massacre, or were spectators were also shot at.\n\nReports of the dead are non-existent, the pressure put on the American medical system by the anarchy in the country makes it impossible to know how many have died, and the government has yet to make an announcement on such a figure. \n\nState media reported today that a "Communist Rebellion" had been crushed, and said that 500 police and troops were killed or injured and that civilians had also been killed, but gave little specification.\n\nDemonstrators reportedly attempted to resist the crackdown, throwing bricks and firebombs at soldiers but were largely unsuccessful in their efforts. Commander of the NSM, Burt Colucci, voiced his displeasure at the violent crackdown. He made a statement this morning saying "I am deeply upset about what happened this morning, and will hold those behind this move responsible". He also claimed that the suppression of the protests was organized and executed by hardliners in the party, revealing a split in the NSM, and showing how tenuous his grasp on the party really is."

 nsm.7.d: "Burt Colucci stepped up to his podium, adjusting himself to the bitter air, and prepared himself to speak in front of some of his most ardent supporters. The most committed National Socialists available were here today, prepared to make sure the outside knew he was still in control, that neither the agitators nor the hardliners had been successful in loosening his grasp on the movement.\n\nHe stared into the camera which was broadcasting his speech to state media and began his speech. It was a speech familiar to members of the NSM, telling of their vast achievements, and denouncing their enemies, along with the Jews and Communists who backed them, and finally affirming to all his loyal soldiers that they were unconquerable. He lauded the achievements of his government, voiced support of the soldiers who had put a stop to the riots that had gripped the city, and condemned the Communist Agitators who had started them.\n\nHis speech, as always, was met with thunderous applause and cheering, followed by plenty of "Hail Victory!"s and "Hail Colucci"s. The crowd made liberal use of the Roman salute, a chorus of arms sticking straight out to show their support, and Colucci made sure to give them a salute right back.\n\nColucci quickly made his way off the stage, escorted by his bodyguards. He wanted to make sure that such an amazing speech went uninterrupted by the subversives who infested this city, especially not on camera. Despite that, he felt that he had provided evidence to all that he was still in control, and his enemies had not yet dethroned his position as the face of American Nazism."

 nsm.8.d: "David pressed his foot against the gas pedal, he tried his hardest to concentrate on the road but the blaring noise around him and the oppressive humidity  made it practically impossible. The screeching sirens behind him, the wails of his infant son in the passenger seat, the symphony of the highway had encircled him in a cocoon of sound, and were driving their way into his mind, giving him an intolerable headache. \nWorst of all, however, were the voices. \nThe voices gnawed at his skull from the inside, whispering to him, making sure that he could never be alone in his own mind.It was them who had forced him to take his own son hostage and speed down the I-94, convincing him that it was the only way to secure their safety. He shifted in his leather seat, made uncomfortable by the heat of the sun, and it's glare, which obscured his vision.  \nSuddenly, figures emerged from the glare. \nIt was a barricade. A barricade of police cruisers surrounded by a thin line of traffic spikes. It was over. He knew now for certain that they were going to capture him, and that they would likely shoot him. He pinned his foot to the breaks, bringing his car to a screeching halt. There was no option now but to surrender to them, regardless of consequence. He stumbled out the car door, at last giving himself up. \nIt was then that the voices began to get louder.\n'Sir, put your hands in the air!' shouted one of the officers. \nThe voices again got louder, they only whispered before but now they were speaking with much greater intensity. \n'Sir, you need to put your hands in the air', said the officer, repeating himself, though this time much louder \nThe voices were shouting now, drowning out the sounds of the road. Leaving only the commands of the police and themselves. \n'Sir! For the last time, put your hand in the air!' barked the officer, now clearly having lost his patience \nThey screamed now. All other noise had been driven out by them as their loud, piercing cries shattered his skull from the inside. \nThe voices were silenced by a policeman's bullet."

He sighs as he looks at the map of Michigan, the militia had been causing him a lot of trouble, more soldiers had gone missing, and the paranoia was growing. While pouring in the scotch, he started writing a new order for his warriors.\n\n\"I want every single person who is even slightly rumored to be sympathizing or aligned with the Hutaree militia to be dragged out and hung, no matter who or when, make sure none of them are left!\""

Recently, they bombed our headquarters, killing sixteen of our men and leaving an additional thirteen wounded in their wake. After this attack shook our ranks to the core, Burt has decided enough is enough. From now on, anyone found sympathizing or working with the terrorists will be permanently dealt with. Through rope and steel, we will root out all dissent. Hutaree has played their triumph card, and as they celebrate their victory, it is time to search every forest, every town, every city, and every room.

Such an effort has thankfully begun to bear fruit, with dozens of factories within our territory officially being declared operational, with many members of our government and intrigued citizens attending the re-opening ceremonies of these factories.\n\nAs the familiar sound of whirring machinery rings out once more within our cities, we are already beginning to see the upsides of this endeavor. Already, the response to this measure has been largely positive, both in terms of the public eye and our overall production levels. As a result, a large influx of new jobs have been created, with many appreciative citizens flocking to earn some sort of paying work in the midst of the chaos and uncertainty they've experienced. While a large amount of the populace were initially quite reluctant to take up the much-needed job positions (most likely due to many years of propaganda against movements like ours), it appears that most of them have chosen wisely, seeing the revitalization of work opportunities to generally be a good thing for them and their communities - hesitant as they are to admit it. Apart from some stubborn dissidents who would instead continue being unemployed vagrants rather than contribute to their society, this change is ultimately well-received among our citizenry, and will no doubt contribute immensely to the economy in the long-run."

In the speech leading up to the reveal, those affiliated with the state department, as well as their subsidiary manufacturing representatives expressed delight and pride for their accomplishments regarding such a monumental step towards getting America back on track.\n\nAs the tarp was removed and the vehicle was revealed, many were intrigued as the familiar yet comfortable design was explained by the representatives, before being added on by the state department. The vehicle, dubbed 'the People's Car' by those in charge of the project, would be available at firm yet affordable prices, which sparked the interest of the crowd. The interest only increased as it was revealed that those who met certain conditions - such as working citizenry - would be eligible for purchase and ownership of the vehicle.\n\nState officials claim that the project's release is paramount in their efforts towards reconstruction. "It's incredibly important that we ensure a means of travel to our citizens, especially those who were so deeply affected by the war". Says government official Vincent Garza, one of the overseers of the unveiling. "With the devastation that the conflict brought, it's only natural that we give the people a means of transport; this in turn will increase the ability to return to work, in addition to increased self-sufficiency\"."

Following an earlier speech by Burt Colucci congratulating our members on their combative excellence, the atmosphere remained cheerful as the celebrations began. With post-victory euphoria in the air all across our territory, our members have reacted accordingly - in the streets of Michigan cities and towns, our banners are waved in triumphant fervor as our forces rejoice over their significant triumph against the forces of evil in our home state.\n\nWith all of Michigan brought under our righteous jurisdiction, we have likewise come upon the population of our now-defeated enemies. As expected, most of them outright fear or despise us, and the ones that don't are clearly wary of our presence. While they will eventually come to see the truth of national socialism, a strict sense of order must be implemented to counter leftover subversive elements. Disorder has already been noted in multiple areas, particularly by leftist groups and other agitators in the form of passive resistance and low-level active resistance. These communist holdouts and sympathizers must be uprooted as soon as we're able to do so, lest their ideas of "rebellion" spread.\n\nPerfidious leftist upstarts aside, they are not the only prominent enemy moving against us in the wake of our victory. It appears that while the Hutaree fundamentalists have been crushed in open combat, they clearly refuse to capitulate entirely. Strange activity has been noted in Michigan's northern reaches, with the occasional skirmish between woodland Hutaree holdouts and other odd movements picked up by the group's remnants. Clearly, they are seeking to formulate some sort of organized resistance against our rule - it is crucial that we rout them once more before they act on their hopeless desires.\n\nLet us keep this information in mind when the celebrations end - in the meantime, however, we shall celebrate our glorious strategic accomplishments.

Instead, they have preferred to oversee the state of Alaska as well as their overseas territories - continuing to protect and serve America's holdings in the Pacific ocean. With such a patriotic and admirable task they have undertaken, we initially found it worthwhile to seek some sort of arrangement - one involving their full and immediate incorporation into our movement's banner - and promptly sent the Naval government the demands.\n\nWe received the less-than-optimal response within the week. Admiral Gilday has bluntly rejected our attempts at coercion, reportedly in a manner that could have easily been sufficed by a simple "no". While there was admittedly very little chance of our efforts bearing fruit, it is still very unfortunate that their naval power will be inaccessible to us for the time being (in addition to the slight sense of embarrassment it has brought us)."

 nsm.29.d: "When this nation collapsed in upon itself for the second time in history, we knew from the start that there would never be another opportunity such as this in our lifetime. From the rotting corpse of America, we clawed forwards in defiance of the pitiful "liberal democracy" - an ideology we have long-since seen what it has brought; moral sickness, degeneracy, and the declination of traditions once held dear. From that rot, we fought tooth and nail across the country against all who stood in our way, until finally, the rot dissipated, making us clean through the bloodshed.\n\nTo say that we did it alone, however, would just be disingenuous. Even our most arrogant members cannot deny the importance of the National Front - that being the coalition we formed with other like-minded groups in order to ensure our victory. As the dust clears across the country and order begins being restored, it has quickly been decided that the factions involved within our struggle against the forces of evil will soon convene to discuss the fate of America - the new America, forged through our vision.\n\nWith the conference, however, a new front has opened up - one of influence. Each member of the conference will naturally see themselves as being best-suited to leading America into the new age - therefore, we must adjust ourselves to political maneuvering, rather than outright combat. In order to ensure that our organization becomes the one to lead the country, we must take the necessary steps to legitimize ourselves in the eyes of the conference and the general population.\n\nOf course, some factions will obviously be more favourable than others in terms of leadership. Even prior to the war, there lay a nominal amount of distaste between some member groups for various reasons, some of which are still ever-present towards certain... groups in the conference. Regardless, we know that we and we alone are the ones truly fit to lead this country into greatness, making it imperative that we succeed in negotiations just as much as we succeeded on the battlefield.\n\nLet us get to work - only we know what's best for America, after all."

A disturbing increase in resistance-oriented activities has been seen throughout territories previously believed to have been subjugated by our valiant soldiers. While resistance to our jurisdiction has been expected, it has largely been kept to manageable levels - the occasional hit and run attack, or ambush against our forces in previously contested areas, which was usually repaid via brute force by our troops. However, such a sharp increase in activity is highly unprecedented; not a day goes by when our soldiers aren't hassled by skirmishes, ambushed in urban areas, or beset upon and sabotaged in other ways. On top of it all, there have been sightings of more and more subversive, communistic propaganda - no doubt put in place by the "resistance" in an attempt to cause law-abiding citizens to foolishly throw their lives away. While we have been tearing down and covering up this filth when we find it, the idea of the populace undergoing leftist radicalization against us is severely alarming to consider. \n\nA sense of nervousness and dread hangs over our organization, as we realize that these attacks are far from random - these rebels are more organized than we initially anticipated. With these ferocious acts becoming bolder and more commonplace, it is becoming very clear that something big is imminent. Whatever that may be, we must dig in and prepare - or else our Movement may just be quashed in its infancy from the inside."

In various coordinated attacks, our brave soldiers were savagely ambushed in several urban areas, beset upon by militants identified by their red armbands. In many affected areas, our troops have been viciously and suddenly overrun, having been caught unceremoniously off guard due to the sheer organization of the assault, and the complicity of many civilians in the attacks themselves. An emergency session within our high command was called for, in which several orders to fall back to our more well-defended positions were given and are in the process of being carried out.\n\nAs we have hastily reorganized to face the bastards head on, we have received some sparse transmissions from these revolt leaders, offering only one phrase; "Death to the nazi scum." The line has been drawn, and we must NOT fall to these communist upstarts! We must use any and all methods at our disposal to ensure that our ultimate victory is assured here, lest our progress all be for nothing! All of the movement understands that not just our fate, but the fate of national socialism - of the Aryan race! - rests upon our shoulders. We will not falter!"

As fires rage on throughout many cities and towns (many of them set during the fighting by desperate leftists), the reprisal for such a treacherous act has been brutal, and rightfully so. Beatings and executions of surviving rebels have become commonplace as they watch in horror that their plan to destroy America's future has horribly failed - ensuring nothing other than their imminent deaths.\n\nWhile the odds were initially stacked against us, our victory was naturally assured, with our victory being overwhelming. With most of the resistance's leadership and underlings dead or dying, we have effectively obliterated most, if not all forms of active resistance among the civilian population for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, we must remain increasingly vigilant from now on to ensure that such a disastrous revolt never occurs ever again."

The constant sound of metallic clanging, the whirr of hydraulics, the glaring heat of the furnaces. More often than not, this overload of the senses overwhelmed newer workers something terrible. A few months ago, Jordan felt very much the same when he first set foot into the halls of the factory. The noise, the terrible heat, the unfamiliarity of it all - it was an uncomfortably new experience, one that he had thankfully started to get acquainted with.\n\nJordan had never expected to be working in a place such as this. Being a former restaurant server, he had to adjust to his new line of work the hard way. When the neo-nazis had managed to take control of all of Michigan, he merely tried to keep his head down - he knew that this wasn't like the days before the war, where there were police present wherever they had their rallies. Now, those enforcing the law and those with swastikas were one and the same, and he had seen pretty clearly that they were much less tolerant of criticism. Ruthless enforcement aside, Jordan felt little need to interact with the black-clothed soldiers patrolling the streets. When word came of job opportunities in regards to "industrial reconstruction", however, he had grown curious and went to see what had drawn the crowds.\n\nJordan idly cast his gaze towards the inner-walls of the complex he worked in. Tinted with the glow of the blazing furnace within it, he could make out the assortment of NSM-oriented posters and flags, lined with words of encouragement to the laborers such as himself. On the same wall hung the same swastika banner - as well as that other symbol that had been there since he started working again, complete with the stars and stripes aspect as if to remind you what country you were currently in. Whenever he saw it, he felt as if he had to remind himself of his own beliefs and convictions; that he was doing this because he needed to earn a living, that countless others had done the same as him, that he knew he wasn't some sort of skinhead and rather someone just trying to get by. He had been raised to be tolerant of others, so he had nothing to worry about. Besides, it's not like he was in any situation to turn down the offer, right? No sane person could blame him for that, surely.\n\nHe snapped out of his thoughts as remembered that he had a job to finish, lest he piss off the foreman. So, he adjusted his protective equipment, and proceeded back to the familiar industrial inferno."

While Patriot Front and the NSM are ideologically somewhat different, the former representing Fascism and the latter National Socialism, they have realized that either of them wish to establish a new government where white people once again are the dominant group in the country, they will have to work together. It is simply militarily infeasible for either the Patriot Front or the NSM to take along the combined might of the American Constitution Government and the Union of America on their own.\n\nAlthough the National Front alliance currently only consists of the Patriot Front and the National Socialist Movement, there are rumors that more organizations may soon join in the future. The Southern Nationalist League of the South and the accelerationist Mason worshiping terrorist organization known as the Atomwaffen Division have both reportedly sent observers to the first National Front conference. However, it is likely that the more organizations that join the National Front, the less cohesive its goals will become.

They are led by Paul Rogers, the former adjutant general of the Michigan National Guard. He was missing in action for the duration of the Civil War, presumably dead, though has now returned to be a thorn in our side once more. Several ammunition deposits in the Huron-Manistee forests have also been discovered, revealing that these rats have been stockpiling behind our backs for years.\n\nTheir attacks consist of hit-and-run assaults on the periphery of the city, sabotaging local infrastructure, and high-intensity urban warfare meant to spur a protracted battle that would leave our military crippled. Notably, they have come into direct conflict with the Hitlerite traitors, who are also active in Detroit, though the liberal apparatus of their organization makes this unsurprising. This infighting allows us to more easily restore order and punish the perpetrators, though we should not underestimate them in battle.

 nsm.42.d: "Amidst our efforts to salvage the moldering corpse of the United States of America, we have received reports that vile conservatives across Wisconsin have begun organizing, protesting, and rioting, mostly in the decadent countryside which has bred their types for years. These thugs seem to be an offshoot of the Three Percenters, a militia group loyal to Donald J. Trump that was mostly wiped out during the Civil War. They are led by Barry Croft Jr., a militia commander known for his role in a failed plot to kidnap the governor of Michigan years before the Civil War. These vermin have already taken swaths of land in Northern Wisconsin, with the military being dispatched to handle the insurgency.\n\nTheir tactics consist of hit-and-run attacks on our garrisons, urban terrorism, and rural guerilla warfare, which has utterly crippled our ability to properly govern and maintain order. They are also well situated within the forested regions of northeastern Wisconsin, allowing them to utilize their knowledge of the terrain to their advantage. Liberal agitators have also taken this as an opportunity to spread their flagrant degeneracy, with riots in Milwaukee quickly escalating. It is imperative that we crush this uprising thoroughly and without haste before it can take root, or else they will inspire other tribespeople like them to take up arms and contaminate America with their filth."

 nsm.43.d: "Amidst our efforts to salvage the moldering corpse of the United States of America, we have received reports that the Hitlerites, once our comrades in arms, have resorted to tribal thievery and barbaric looting. A series of illegal gatherings, marches, and rallies held in Detroit by hardliner Paul Mullet have escalated into aggressive rioting and unrest, with the Hitlerite thugs lighting the city ablaze and destroying years of hard work. These men, once respected members of our movement, have now revealed themselves as nothing but tribalistic agitators, willing to fall in line with Marxists and Liberals to destroy America. Open clashes between our men on the ground and the Hitlerite vermin have already begun, with multiple officers already being wounded. It is now clear to us that their goal is to incite an armed uprising, with Mullet openly stating that we have "lost the mandate of the Aryan nation". If our vision for a new America is to be realized, then we cannot tolerate this obstreperous behavior and must take immediate action against Mullet's roving street gangs, for anything less would only embolden them. The Regional Command in Michigan has also sent out numerous calls for military reinforcements as a result of how dire the situation has gotten, and it is up to us to heed their pleas."

 nsm.44.t: "Raid Executed On Upper Peninsula"
 nsm.44.d: "At approximately 1:3 Am last night, NSM forces were able to completely cut off communications of Michigan's upper peninsula, and a mere three hours later, the entire peninsula was in our hands. The accolades for the success of the operation are ultimately owed to the brave efforts of a handful of NSM commanders, who took the entire weight of the responsibility for the invasion on their shoulders.\n\n Assiduously planned for months, the operation required the collaboration of hundreds of sleeper agents in the Upper Peninsula, from small-town mayors flipped to our side to bribed militia officers. When the operation was announced, most were shocked by its fantastical success. Trump's faction has been shaken to its core, and his coterie of hangers-on, tribal financiers, and other such grafters are likely cursing themselves for allowing their greed and stupidity to obfuscate our intentions.\n\n With this victory, our control over northern Lake Michigan has been solidified, while our ability to project power over Lake Superior has finally been enabled. The people of the peninsula have greeted their liberation with joy, taking to the streets, with provided Party flags for the pictures, to greet our victorious armies, and eagerly handing over subversive elements to us. Numerous ideologically sympathetic militiamen, or simple opportunists, have defected to our ranks, swelling the size of our forces in the area. "

However, following his announcement many political figures have come to the stage hoping to be his successor. The two most prominent characters are Andrew Anglin and Paul Mullet. Anglin has built a reputation of loyalty to the NSM throughout his career and stated multiple times that he would continue the ideas of Colucci during his leadership.  Mullet has built his reputation upon much of the same reasons as Anglin, however, he has stated that while he would continue the core values of the NSM, he would add the ideas of Christianity to the movement. Whoever is chosen will most definitely make a big impact on the NSM during this new era, and now with Colucci making his final decision, he announced that…"

Furthermore, we have uncovered secret communications between Rockwellian officials and prominent civilian organizations. Intelligence reports warn that failure to address these subversive activities could result in widespread hostility towards our regime among the civilian population.

Fortunately, our local security forces managed to negotiate with the assailants, successfully de-escalating the situation. As a result, all hostages were safely liberated, and the eight perpetrators were peacefully apprehended. \n \n However, the discovery of a coded message on one of the captors has raised concerns. After decryption by our intelligence department, it unveiled a series of instructions and locations. It appears the Rockwellain party orchestrated the attack, providing directions on seizing the political building and various locations of arms caches. \n \n This incident signifies a troubling escalation in tensions between our party and the Rockwellains, as their actions continue to grow increasingly audacious"

While many officials worry that the policy has come too soon and that it will break already tense relationships our government has made with foreign racial elements, the central government ultimately decided that bringing an immediate end to racial subversion was more important than political expediency.\n\n When the so-called "Jim Crow" laws fell, and shortly thereafter similar laws across the country, a period of chaos began across the country. Blacks rioted in numerous cities, as the police presence that was instituted to keep their community in check was rapidly curtailed. Whites fled urban areas for the suburbs en masse while blacks were left with the charred results of their folly. Of course, the tribal policymakers who made the laws in the first place were unaffected, hiding behind cops in their gated communities.\n\nTo ameliorate the urban situation, the government will fund whites who want to move into newly renovated communities, while alien elements will be expelled into homogenous areas of their own. Existing infrastructure will be split in half, black and white: schools, parks, drinking fountains, the works. Social mixing will be discouraged by giving grants to businesses that enforce segregation, while also withholding child support from single mothers of mixed-race children.\n\nTo generally restore order among the minorities, massive weapon confiscation efforts will be carried out. Due to the Civil War and mass criminality, dangerous arms have proliferated in alien communities, and as such they must be disarmed to preserve the fragile peace. Rural alien communities must be dissolved, or consolidated so that they may be easily monitored."
