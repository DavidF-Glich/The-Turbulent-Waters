 congo.1.t: "Third Congo War"
 congo.1.d: "Following months of economic turmoil after the oil crisis, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has once again collapsed into an era of warlordism. Following a failed attempt of the opposition group \"Alliance of the Democratic Forces of Congo\" to take power, they have once again taken up arms in the Northeastern region of the nation, vowing to restore order by any means neccessary. Meanwhile, seperatist groups backed by Rwanda in the East have intensified their efforts for independence. In the south, the long tumultuous Katanga region has also seceeded, vying to carve their own future free from the central authority in Kinshasa.\n\nThe DRC, already the 6th poorest nation faces an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. With millions in the interior dependent on the foreign aid and the export economy for their livlihoods, their lives hang in the balance. Substinance farmers too, face shortages as fighting is expected to destroy large swaths of arable land."

 car.7.t: "The Federation of Soldiers"
 car.7.d: "While news out of Central Africa and the former Democratic Republic of the Congo have been particularly sparse as of late, a string of developments are emerging that have not gone unnoticed by the mainstream media. Amid a grueling Civil War that left the country in its worst humanitarian crisis since the 1990s, ''Gleb'', a mysterious Russian mercenary with connections to the Private Military Company ''Wagner Group,'' has prevailed over the many factions in the region vying for power. Several "Civil-Military Administrations" have been established across the country to properly govern, relying on international mercenaries and local collaborators to maintain a stranglehold on power. The latest development in the Congo Crisis has seen Gleb and the Council of Commanders declare the ''Federation of Soldiers'' to be the new state apparatus presiding over the administration of the country. This has also resulted in the country's pivot to neutrality, effectively splitting the Wagner Group. With this announcement, it is expected that Private Military Companies will experience a soar in attention and revenue, with it already being one of the largest businesses in the world as a consequence of the events shaping the global landscape in recent years. Underground resistance groups scattered across the Congo were also quick to release statements on the matter, reiterating that they will do whatever it takes to reclaim their homeland from the occupiers.
