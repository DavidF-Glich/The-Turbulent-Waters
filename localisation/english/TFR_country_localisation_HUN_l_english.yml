 Hungary.1.t: "The Third Hungarian Republic"
 Hungary.1.d: "In 1989, with the death of the Soviet Union on the horizon, the Communist government forced upon the Hungarian people was crumbling, and although peaceful, the Hungarian people quickly shed the red cloak of Communism and adopted a Western Democracy. \n\nBut the menace of Communism would again arise when the economy of Hungary, not used to privatization and free trade quickly ran the country into an economic slump. Thankfully, after two decades of political upheaval, Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party took control of Hungary and has restored it to its former glory!"
 Hungary.1.a: "The Dream of József Antall Lives on!"
 Hungary.2.t: "Hungary enters the 2020s"
 Hungary.2.d: "For the past decade, Orbán and his Fidesz party have held complete control over Hungary, and as the nation enters a new decade, many within Hungary view Orbán as the savior of Hungary, while many view him as a Russian-Friendly dictator waiting for his time to strike. Only time will tell whether or not the Hungarian people shall see the end to Fidesz rule, or if Hungary will enter the 2030s as they entered the 2020s, under Fidesz rule."

Money slides from the hands of one man to another, a political entrepeneur, building himself up to be the next Orbán, or so he thinks... \nThe other man, a roommate of a journalist who's about to expose some low-level scandal. \n\nNothing to lose, everything to gain... The motto of Orbán's Hungary. Both men leave the room having gained something, one leaves knowing the scandal he caused is gonna be lost to the annals of the Danube, the other leaves with a mission and a handful of of neatly stacked forints."

Tensions between Brussels and Budapest had already reached an astonishing high as Hungary's Eurosceptic administration clashed with EU officials on a variety of grounds regarding EU policies on Hungary. Analysts across the continent are shocked as many have pointed out the strong impact this will have on Hungary's economy as it is heavily reliant on the EU. Officials in Budapest have so far dismissed the concerns over economics and diplomacy citing the multiple issues already with Brussels when Hungary was still in the union. However, all debate on the issue of leaving has ended now that all Article 50 proceedings with Hungary have been completed. Henceforth, Hungary is no longer a member of the EU and will have all assets, agreements, organizations, responsibilities, and other provisions that came with their membership revoked in full. Time will soon tell the full repercussions of Budapest's decision to leave the union."

The acceptance of these new positions by Hungary has been meet with warm sentiments by EU diplomats. Officials in Brussels have voiced their strong praise of the new direction by Hungary, citing their gratitude for Hungary's reaffirming of ''its European and democratic future.'' Analysts have pointed out that this is a big blow to Moscow as Hungary was seen as one of the friendliest to Russia in the region.

Russia has in response congratulated Hungary on its recent change of policy and further states that they are with great anticipation looking forward to further cooperation. Current statements by EU diplomats have condemned the new efforts by Hungary as undermining European unity and as an irresponsible move as both an EU and NATO member. Analysts on the continent have pointed out that the newfound relationship between Russia and Hungary is a major blow to the EU's efforts of keeping Russian influence out of the union.
