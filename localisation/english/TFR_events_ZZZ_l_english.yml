 states.22.t: "Tank Duel in Louisville"
 states.22.d: "Through international channels, videos of a supposed tank duel between two American M1 Abrams has leaked during the battle of Louisville. The first Abrams, loyal to the Denver Government and holding amateur film creator known as JTAmerica76, entered the empty intersection from South 8th Street following the capture of the Jefferson County Judicial Center and proceeded to engage a few retreating D.C Government forces. Several seconds later, a second Abrams comes into frame and after a few seconds of failing to hail it over comms, the tank is revealed to be loyal to the D.C. Government. \n\nAfter a brief moment of confusion, the second tank is seen to fire a round right above the camera, followed by a return fire by the first tank, hitting just under the gun and causing the second tank to burst into flames. The camera then pans to the commander of the first tank, identified as Chad Blackburn, the son of senator Marsha Blackburn, who is seen praying. \nAlthough the D.C. Government has yet to respond to this video, many users online have proven its authenticity through pictures of the flaming husk lying on the streets of Louisville."

 states.23.d: "As the dust settles on the once pristine capital, it seems that the president, the now legitimised cincinnatus of the American dream, Donald J. Trump, has been able to route Biden loyalists from the outskirts of the city. \n\nIn a speech to his soldiers on the steps of the capital building, the place where the election had been certified mere years earlier, Trump stood defiantly, proclaiming ''The true Patriots of America have drained the swamp! Our amazing army has retaken the blessed and amazing city of our forefathers, and much like President Jackson before me, we have shown our enemy we are not to be underestimated! I bet that Sleepy Joe didn't expect us to ever get this far! We are giving the people of this great nation a dream worth cherishing! A dream where Americans feel pride in their country.'' \nWith jubilation ringing throughout the towns of the heartland America, a sense of vigor and patriotism has struck the American people, but alongside that, a pain and an anger for the destruction of such precious monuments and celebrations of the American spirit. Never since the sacking of D.C. in 1812 has the American capital seen such destruction."

However just before reaching the so-called ''River Entrance,'' a massive explosion rocked the building, as the ground underneath the building seemed to implode. \n\nAlthough the building was secured, the information that was once held under the Pentagon, whether it be the tactics employed by Unionist forces, or possible spies and collaborators is now lost forever."

 states.26.d: "As the smoke clears over the California capital, it appears that the Red General himself, Michael Prysner, has successfully driven National Guard forces from the heart of the city. The American People's Liberation Army now controls Sacramento. \n\nStanding atop an armored personnel carrier in front of the Capitol building, where just years ago state legislators debated capitalist policies, Prysner addressed his  triumphant troops: ''Comrades! The workers of America have broken their chains! Our valiant People's Army has liberated this stronghold of bourgeois oppression. The capitalist dogs cowered behind their precious profits, blind to the rising tide of class consciousness! But now, comrades, we forge a new destiny - not with gold, but with the iron will of the workers. From factory floor to fertile field, all shall toil and reap as equals. The gears of industry turn not for the few, but for the many!'' \n\nAs news of the victory spreads, many across the world wonder, will Communism finally infect in America?"

The city's mayor was reportedly taken into custody by APLA forces shortly after the attack began.\n\nThe capture of Portland is also likely to have major implications for the rest of the country. Portland, a city known for its progressive politics and strong support for left-wing causes, has long been a center of resistance to the government's policies. The APLA's capture of the city is likely to inspire other left-wing groups across the country and could lead to a surge in support for the APLA's cause."

Several Special Forces squads were dropped into the city and neighboring suburbs to cut communication between brigades defending the outskirts of the city. By next morning, mechanized brigades entered various suburbs and began slowly retaking them back one by one. In the face of a mechanized, armored, and aeiral assaults, The city's communist defenders began to surrender in droves.

Operations began at daybreak with squads advancing rapidly through the undefended outskirts until finally meeting organized Communist and Anti-Fascist resistance in the city's suburbs. Progress was slow, every building needing a througough sweeping to ensure all defenders were either dead or had surrendered. Portland is still a hotbend for anti-conservative sentiment. Rioters and protestors were quick to run to the streets and halt the advance of the militiamen. Assaults on militiamen by random civilians are frequent at night.

The offensive to take the city is reportedly one of the most intense out of the entire east coast theatre of the 2nd American Civil War. Large segments of the city have been raised as chaotic urban warfare has made the urban landscape unrecognizable for many. Many doubted that anarchist militia formations would be able to inflict that much destruction on a major city, but they have been thoroughly proven wrong. AoTF forces used grenades, Molotov cocktails, improvised explosives, and other weapons to clear out even the smallest of defensive positions within the city. According to after-action reports given by AoTF paramilitaries and what limited information was given to the press, the anarchists needed to go house to house, clearing every floor individually as the defenders of the city held themselves up in almost every livable space. Civilian accounts have painted an even more chaotic picture as many report that Boston now resembles a 'Stalingrad on the east coast'. AoTF forces have publicly announced that their capture of Boston will serve as an important base for advancing on the rest of the region.
