 KOS_partial_lack_of_recognition: "Partial Lack of Recognition"
 KOS_partial_lack_of_recognition_desc: "The writing on the wall was already in place when Yugoslavia's dying breaths echoed the sins of Serbian nationalism. When we rose up with the help of NATO, we fought valiantly and managed to withstand the Serb onslaught, bringing freedom to the Albanians of Yugoslavia which had been repressed for more than a century. As the frontlines stabilised and the roars of mortar shells slowly quieted down, the situation we found ourselves in immediately became apparent. Serbia and her allies had valiantly refused to recognise our independence, not mention refusing to even acknowledge us diplomatically as a separate partner. As a result we've fallen into the gray area of being a partially recognized state, thus being forbidden from joining the EU and the UN which had supported us decades before. In spite of this, we have found close support from the western powers and in particular our brothers in Tirana - and from the coming storm, it looks like our foreign situation is unlikely to change as the vigor of Serbian nationalism still stands unscathed."
 KOS_Serbian_minority_tensions_high: "Serbian Minority Tensions - High"
 KOS_Serbian_minority_tensions_high_desc: "Compared to the rest of the Balkans, Kosovo could be considered one of the few states which seriously acknowledges it's minorities, Turkish, Serbian, Bosniak and Roma languages being officially recognized and some measures to ensure egalitarianism being put in place. Despite this, old grudges from our war of independence are still one of the biggest problems we have been facing even to this day. Serbians still occasionally organize terrorist attacks and street brawls, with human lives being lost under the justification that we are trying to 'reduce' the Serbian minority by enforcing the Albanian language to promote cooperation amongst our minorities. The tensions are however a cause for concern, with clashes on our border with Serbia having become more recent, and distrust between our people becoming more rampant and even alleged downright mortar attacks taking place in some of our towns and riots engulfing Pristina. §RIf we don't want Kosovo boiling over into its own civil war or even a downright second war against Serbia, we have to take measures to promote cooperation and stop the immediate disputes.§!"
 KOS_backwater_of_the_balkans: "Backwater of the Balkans"
 KOS_backwater_of_the_balkans_desc: "Political upheaval, war and the general conflicts of the Balkans have become second nature to lands of Illyria, and it has become increasingly clear that Kosovo was one of the states to suffer the most from the decades of clashes. Our economy had largely been stagnant for the past decades, with our winegrowing industry not seeing any growth and our resources staying untapped, not to mention the poor state of our infrastructure. Despite this, Kosovo lies as one of the balkan states with the most untapped potential due to our huge deposits of minerals and fertile arable land, with the few blessings being our management to narrowly dodge post-war inflation and the 2008 financial crisis. All it takes is to utilize our resources carefully and to begin reinvesting back into our economy, and we will be able to rise up from being a borderline failed state, and perhaps we will be able to stand a fighting chance against Serbia in the event that NATO support vanishes."
 KOS_pawn_of_nato: "Pawn of NATO"
 KOS_pawn_of_nato_desc: "The very independence of Kosovo could only come about with the help of our allies in Washington and London. As Belgrade burned with the help of NATO bombers, our troops pushed back the Serbs as their politicians capitulated to the unstoppable pressure from our alliance. While it no doubt left a major sour taste in the mouths of Serbia, it had guaranteed our independence for the past twenty years. This partnership however has slowly moulded itself into a reliance, and as a result the KSF never truly deemed it necessary for Kosovo to form its own air force, nor did it see armament production at home as feasible. With the coming instability of the USA, many of our politicians have started deeming the idea of asserting our own military autarky a necessity as tensions in the Balkans continue to grow."
