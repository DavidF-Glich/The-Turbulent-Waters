 TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Bad_End: "The United States of America, which once stood at the pinnacle of the world, no longer has its former glory. For decades, we have gradually lost our advantage in the cold war game with China. The economic decline, political polarization, and social turmoil have made everyone on this land feel desperate like never before. \n\n The technological advantages that once led the world have now been almost wiped out by China; once the world's most powerful force, today it can only be supported in a crisis; the economic engine that once drove the world is now struggling in the recession, and it is no longer angry. The cracks in society are getting deeper and deeper, the class division is serious, the dissatisfaction of the people is getting worse, and street protests and conflicts have become a daily landscape. Our allies are gradually moving away, and our former partners and ideological comrades-in-arms have also lost confidence in us. \n\n In this land that once led the world, flames are rising, and the stars and stripes are swaying in the wind and rain. It is very likely that after losing its hegemonic status, the United States will fall into the long river of history and become a bleak memory. \n\n Good night, America. \n\n Thank you for visiting the United States! Thank you for playing this mod! "
 TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Generic: "The United States holds its breath. After experiencing the turbulent 2020s, the United States has entered a new era with a new look. Powerful new technologies began to appear, new leaders gradually took over power, and a new generation of people stepped to the polling station one after another. \n\n It is true that not all difficulties and obstacles have been safely overcome: war still exists, discrimination has not been eliminated, and the suffering of mankind has not left. These devil creations cannot be defeated, let alone perished. But as long as the torch of freedom burns on this dark horizon, the United States will survive. "

The leader's teachings still resound on the radio, and the street slogans are still bright red as blood. The system is like a §Aperpetual motion machine§! , Running accurately and indifferently. Obedience and exhaustion are engraved on the faces of the people, but it is difficult to find the shadow of the future in their eyes. History has stagnated here, and North Korea seems to be an echo of the 20th century, a relic that refuses to be touched by time. \n\n§1 However, under the unchanging appearance, is the power of silence accumulating? §!
