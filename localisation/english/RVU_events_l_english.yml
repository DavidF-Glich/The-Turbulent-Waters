 Russo_Ukrainian_war1: "Our leniency towards the neo-Nazi forces in Ukraine has already caused a severe geopolitical disaster. We must correct our past mistakes—before they destroy us."
 Russo_Ukrainian_war2: "The evil Putin clique has once again ordered their Russian Empire to launch an attack on the Ukrainian Republic. As a bastion of democracy and a protector of world security, we must prevent the spirits of the tsars and Stalin from returning. Additionally, we cannot allow China to align with Russia."
 Russo_Ukrainian_war3: "The war initiated by Russia has brought us to the center of the world stage in a comically ironic manner. We need to find supporters internationally, make friends, and reduce our enemies."
 Russo_Ukrainian_war4: "Thanks to the 30 years of painstaking efforts by the US and Russia in Ukraine, the Soviet civil war has finally erupted. Russia's security demands, national economy, the territorial integrity of Ukraine, the well-being of its people, and the stability of the world economy are all facing significant challenges. As a responsible great power, we should take action."

 PRC_Blame_USA_decision_desc: "According to data released by the US Treasury, the number of sanctions implemented by the US has increased tenfold over the past 20 years. During the previous US presidential term, the number of sanctions reached 3,800, which amounts to an average of three sanctions per day. Since 2011, the US has imposed sanctions on Russia more than 100 times. However, have these sanctions solved the problem? Has the world become better due to US sanctions? Will the Ukrainian issue be naturally resolved due to US sanctions on Russia? Will European security be more secure due to US sanctions on Russia? It is hoped that relevant parties will seriously consider these questions and strive to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation."
