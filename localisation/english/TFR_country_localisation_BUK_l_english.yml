  baath.1.t: "Ba'athism Returns to Iraq"
  baath.1.d: "The Naqshbandi Order under Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri - the so called ''King of Clubs'' during the Iraq War - have seized Iraq after successfuly capturing Baghdad, defeating islamist and government militias during the second civil war to grace Iraq in the last two decades. Izzat had served as Saddam Hussein's second in command and succeeded in the leadership of the Iraqi Ba'athist Party after Saddam was executed. Now that America's presence in the Middle East has collapsed, the Naqshbandi Army has went on to re-establish Ba'athist policies throughout Iraq and reports of a purge of remaining dissidents going underway. Already there have been calls for retaliation against Iran's failed invasion prior to the civil war, and for Saddam's legacy to be avenged as ultranationalism sees a revival as the embittered Iraqi populace call for revenge against western imperialism and for Iraq to return to the greatest of its Saddam Era. In his first televised speech since ascending to power, Izzat has promised to bring an end to foreign backed violent islamist rebellions in the country, for the economy to be revitalised and for any remnants of western meddling in the country to be purged with prejudice."
  baath.1.a: "Ba'athism is far from being out of fashion, so it seems."
  baath.2.t: "Death of Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri"
  baath.2.d: "After a few mere months in office, Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri - the right hand man of Saddam Hussein - has abruptly died after complications from his longtime suffering from leukemia reached its peak. While Izzat has lived long enough to re-establish Ba'athism in Iraq, his succession has been put into question as the Ba'athist party wrangles in what has been presumed to be a minor power struggle to nominate a new successor. In the mean time, a nationwide week-long mourning period has been declared as a funeral procession of the deceased Izzat took place in his home town of Tikrit on the Tigris River, with a notable personal appearance of Bashar Al-Assad at his burial and several leaders of different Ba'athist parties from around the Arab World."
  baath.2.a: "The Knight of Baath has dismounted from his horse."
  baath.3.t: "Salah Al-Mukhtar Ascends as Iraqi President"
  baath.3.d: "The succession crisis in Iraq following the abrupt death of its first Ba'athist leader since the fall of Saddam Hussein came to a resolve as the Iraqi Military came to back Salah Al-Mukhtar, the new head of the Iraqi Ba'athist party as the new president of Iraq. In his first television address, Al-Mukhtar promises to uphold Izzat's wishes for Iraq to regain its global status and to avenge Saddam Hussein's dream to unite Kuwait and Khuzestan with Iraq, while simultanously reviving the Iraqi economy and committing Iraq towards a path of patriotism and nationalism. Wherever his goals will come to fruitition however, are yet to be seen, as Iraq continues its recovery from yet another civil conflict."
  baath.3.a: "We will pull through!"
