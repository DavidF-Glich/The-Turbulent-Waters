 CAN_quebec_separatism_idea: "Quebec Separatism"
 CAN_quebec_separatism_idea_desc: "The French-speaking population in the province of Québec has always been somewhat unhappy with the dominance of the Anglo-Canadian population in the Ottawa government. Thoughts of independence are common and so are votes to secede from Canada - the last one in 1995 had a 49.42% 'Yes' turnout. The threat of Quebec leaving the union is more than real."

We must muster the strength of all Canadians whether Anglo or Québécois, and the strength of the many refugess seeking shelter from the tyranny in America. Canada is united, and ready to answer the call of Liberty."

 canada.11.t: "Conservatives Oust Trudeau in Snap Election"
 canada.11.d: "The Conservative Party of Canada has emerged victorious in a snap federal election, bringing an end to the long-standing Trudeau era after political fallout from a disastrous military withdrawal in New England. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who called the election hoping to secure a renewed mandate, was instead dealt a resounding defeat as his government's handling of the crisis left the nation deeply divided.\n\nIn the aftermath of the ill-fated military operation, public dissatisfaction with the Liberal government reached a boiling point, with many Canadians viewing the intervention as an unnecessary entanglement in foreign conflicts. Voters turned to the Conservative Party, led by populist pitchman Pierre Poilievre, who campaigned on promises of restoring stability, accountability, and putting an end to what he framed as reckless foreign policies.\n\nThe Conservatives secured a clear majority, ending nearly a decade of Liberal rule. Trudeau's fall marks the close of an era defined by progressive social policies and international diplomacy but increasingly overshadowed by controversies, ranging from his handling of Covid-19 to accusations of authoritarian rule."
 canada.11.a: "Good riddance!"
 canada.12.t: "Liberals Cling to Power in Canada"
 canada.12.d: "Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada have narrowly won a snap federal election, clinging to power despite widespread unpopularity and mounting controversies. Once hailed as a progressive leader, Trudeau's tenure has been marred by economic struggles, incompetence, and a disastrous military intervention in New England that has tainted his legacy.\n\nThe military operation, launched to suppress the Patriot Front in New England, spiraled into a costly quagmire, leading to Canadian casualties and economic strain. This intervention, intended to bolster regional security, has instead become a symbol of Trudeau's declining credibility, drawing comparisons to Tony Blair's legacy after the Iraq War. Many Canadians view the conflict as an unnecessary entanglement that exacerbated domestic issues.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Trudeau scraped by with a slim victory, a reflection of a deeply divided electorate. His narrow win signals not renewed confidence but rather a fractured political landscape, leaving the Prime Minister to lead a weakened government as he faces an ever-growing public discontent and challenges to his leadership. Many now wonder, how long can he stay before it all comes crashing down?"
 canada.12.a: "Trudeau still holds on"
 canada.13.t: "Fascism Rising"
 canada.13.desc: "As the conditions of stability around the world continue to deteriorate under the pressures of the pandemic, the economic collapse, and numerous other crises, many Canadians are turning to extreme ideas. Inspired by Canadian fascist ideologues from the previous century such as Adrien Arcand and John Ross Taylor, as well as the waves of new far-right ideas emanating from our southern neighbor, fascist parties and political organizations have seen record numbers of new recruits.\n\nQuebecois groups such as Atalante and the mostly anglophone IDCanada have seen an uptick in their mobilisations, and the Canadian branches of American-based organizations such the Atomwaffen Division and the Proud Boys have also seen rapid growth. In order to prevent threats to Canada's national security, the RCMP and all other levers of state security must be used in order to combat the influence of these organizations."
