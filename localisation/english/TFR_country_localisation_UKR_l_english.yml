  UKR_government_corruption: "Oligarchy"
  UKR_government_corruption_desc: "For years, oligarchs have exercised influence over our institutions. Bribery, extortion, and other abuses of power have been rampant among public officials. While we have anti-corruption laws, a weak judiciary and a poor economy make their enforcement difficult and, in some cases, impossible."

  UKR_minsk_protocol_desc: "\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_UKR_minsk_protocol\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2014 and 2015, my government reached agreements with the Russian Federation and the OSCE to stop further conflict with separatists in the Donbass region. While fighting has inevitably escalated again since then, the agreements have set out many rules to minimize the scale of fighting and damage on both sides. Under the new Minsk Agreement, we have agreed and signed two main demands: the withdrawal of all long-range artillery equipment in the designated areas and the cessation of further offensive operations against the rebels. We will abide by these agreements and cease any further attacks against Russian separatists."
  UKR_mass_insurgency: "Conflict in Donbass"
  UKR_mass_insurgency_desc: "Two illegal regimes, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, broke away from Ukraine and launched a military campaign against us, claiming to \"liberate\" the Russian minority in Ukraine. To achieve this goal, they formed several rebel groups to fight our forces, and showed some effectiveness in the battles."

  UKR_embargoed_economy_desc: "With Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea, our global trade has come to a virtual standstill. The loss of our major port of Sevastopol has forced us to rebuild a vital hub for our ships to load and transport goods, slowing our economy somewhat, but the risk is well managed."
  UKR_ukrainianrussian_church_schism: "Ukrainian Orthodox Church"
  UKR_ukrainianrussian_church_schism_desc: "In October 2018, the Holy Synod of Constantinople passed a resolution confirming its intention to grant autocephaly to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. The move was widely seen as a political ploy, as the Russian Orthodox Church had previously excommunicated several Ukrainian clergy. The schism between Constantinople and Moscow officially began on October 15, when the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church announced a ban on all members of the Moscow Patriarchate from participating in Holy Communion, baptisms, and weddings. The end result of this event has sparked a wide-ranging discussion about the place of the Orthodox Church in Eastern European politics. The Ukrainian public has generally viewed this positively, seeing it as another step in the process of Ukraine's independence from Russia, although it has further exacerbated tensions between the two countries."

The police force and the army are the most affected departments. In particular, the army, with the protection of some government officials and oligarchs, has funded several far-right armed groups. This not only provides evidence for the Kremlin's accusation of \"hidden fascism\" against us, but also provides an excuse for its actions to support Russian separatist forces in Donbas. Now we are faced with a choice: either embrace these more radical compatriots, or completely weaken their influence and prevent them from being a threat again."

  UKR_country_summary: "§YCountry Introduction§!:\nThe last frontier of Europe, a battlefield of freedom and slavery. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine's path to independence was fraught with difficulties. The 'Dignity Revolution' of 2014 overthrew the pro-Russian regime but led to Russia's seizure of Crimea. The Ukrainian government's exclusionary policy towards the Russian-speaking citizens in the east of Ukraine led to the eastern orientation towards Russia, and the local war in the Donbas region has continued for 6 years. In 2020, Ukraine is still deeply entangled in the geopolitical vortex - to the east is the Russia that is watching with enmity, and to the west is the NATO and the EU that provide assistance but are weak in attitude. The Zelensky government must deal with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic while also finding a way out between reform promises and real difficulties, and between Russia and the EU.\nTo join Russia or to fight? Prosperity or corruption? Zelensky must provide answers."
