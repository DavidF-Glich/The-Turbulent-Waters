 poland.1.t: "Restoration of Glory"
 poland.1.d: "Poland has lost Warsaw... We have been abandoned by those who we considered to be our ''allies,'' and have had our nation split in two like it had been in 1939... With this betrayal we see clearly the disgusting plans that the west had for us, utilizing us as human shields and as a buffer against the Russian Orcs, occupying us in all but name, just as the Soviets did. \n\nPoland will survive this too, but we need to first reclaim our dignity. We cannot allow the disgusting western liberals to continue to dictate our politics, Poland must be free from foreign oppression. Under the leadership of the military, the Polish spirit will continue! The Polish people will survive!"
 poland.1.a: "Poland is Not Yet Lost!"
