 bur.3.t: "Situation in Myanmar"
 bur.3.d: "Myanmar has once again descended into internal conflict, a situation that is hardly surprising given the country's fragile parliamentary politics, entrenched military corruption, chaotic economic conditions, the impact of COVID-19, and long-standing ethnic tensions. However, unlike previous conflicts, the rapid development of the internet and social media has amplified the negative consequences of the military coup, deepening societal divisions and publicizing the civil war. Additionally, increased internet access has drawn more attention to the independent armed groups in the border regions, further expanding their influence.\n\nCurrently, the international community has largely confined itself to verbal condemnations and sanctions targeting individual military junta leaders, without taking substantial action. Nevertheless, this presents an opportunity for us. As the country with the longest shared border with Myanmar, the strongest economic influence, and good relations with both the democratic opposition and the military government, China has the potential to intervene in a way that could fundamentally change the situation. Moreover, among the various warlords involved in the civil war, the United Wa State Army, led by Bao Youxiang, and the Kokang Army have shown a clear pro-China stance, further enhancing our strategic position to intervene and secure tangible benefits."
