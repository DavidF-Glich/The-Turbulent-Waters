 saf.1.t: "2024 South African Elections"
 saf.1.d: "As South Africa undergoes its seventh election since the apartheid era, it has dawned on much of the nation that this particular election will no doubt be monumentous towards the country's future.\n\nAny South African will tell you that recent years have essentially spelled disaster for their country. The economic turbulence seen after the America's collapse has been felt globally, hitting South Africa particularly hard - millions of South Africans are out of work, and the already high poverty rate has only risen within the past few years. In addition to the economic downturns, racial tensions between native Africans and the Boer population have increased tenfold, with harsh reprisals, numerous race riots, and other incidents that have done nothing but inflict pain on fellow citizens. Many analysts have pointedly made references to levels of violence not seen since the apartheid era.\n\nIn the turmoil, an unlikely rising star in South African politics has arisen as what many believe to be the only opposition party that is likely to pose a real threat to the long-reigning African National Congress, that of which being the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters. Their popularity has skyrocketed throughout the economic shortcomings and racial tensions, with many having lost faith in the ANC in recent years. Talks of African nationalism and long-term solutions to the economic crisis have attracted many - however, many others have remained steadfast in their support of the ANC, citing the EFF's worrying record and the possible backlash from supporting such a radical political faction.\n\nRegardless, the election has been hotly-contested thus far, with the ANC coming up short in more places than ever before. As the final ballots are counted, the populace holds their breath as they await what could spell either salvation or destruction."
 saf.1.a: "The ANC Holds On!"
 saf.1.b: "The EFF Pull Off an Upset!"
 saf.2.t: "The ANC Win in South Africa"
 saf.2.d: "As the final votes were counted, the African National Congress breathed a large sigh of relief as their worst fear had thankfully not come true. Albeit by a very tight margin, the ANC had triumphed in what was their most uncertain electoral race yet. Celebratory motions were underway as the ANC and their affiliates congratulated one another on an election well-run - the status quo had been preserved in the face of rising political extremism.\n\nThose across the pond, however, are much less content with the results. The EFF, namely, are furious regarding their defeat in this monumental election, with cries of vote skewering and suppression beginning to trickle further into the assembly. On the streets, joyous ANC supporters rejoice as the radicals have been put down at the ballot box, confident that their decision was well-founded.\n\nUnfortunately, these celebrations happen to be marred with increasing reports of politically-motivated brawls and clashes between supporters of their respective parties, with EFF members making their discontent about the election known as they question the legitimacy of the ANC's victory. Rumours of large congregations of EFF voters engaging in shady, unknown acts have slowly begun to formulate, much to the downplaying of both factions.\n\nWhether or not the status quo is preserved is not necessarily an indication of whether or not the nation's problems are solved - rather, it seems that they're only just beginning."
 saf.2.a: "More of the Same"
 saf.3.t: "The EFF Win in South Africa"
 saf.3.d: "As the final votes were counted, a sinking feeling of panic began to erupt in all those affiliated with the ANC. Some couldn't believe it - others were entirely distraught. For the first time in decades, the status quo in South Africa has been shattered in the face of the far-left EFF.\n\nWhile the mood within the ANC is one of shock and disbelief, the mood within the EFF is one of complete joy and celebration - if out of surprise regarding their own success. For the first time, the will of the people has triumphed over the long-stagnant African National Congress! As celebrations ring out, and speeches from the new President Julius Malema begin, the mood in the air was jubilant.\n\nAt least, for the most part. With how divided the nation has become in recent years (only increased throughout the election campaign), the magnitude of such an upset victory has no doubt ruffled some feathers within the populace. Already, ANC supporters have denounced the victory and have taken to the streets in protest - clashes between them and EFF supporters trickle in, and it is only expected to increase in the coming days. Behind the scenes, rumours run amuck about how the ANC will take this incredible upset to their lengthy period of rule; with some whispering the possibility of an electoral overturn, somehow (something that the EFF will no doubt challenge and strike down to the best of their ability). \n\nIn the end, all that matters is the next steps and changes the new leadership takes - and the average citizen knew very well that they would be big changes indeed. That being said, one would be foolish to assume that the country's problems are over and done with - rather, it appears they may just be getting started."
 saf.3.a: "A Red Banner Over Africa?"
 saf.4.t: "ANC Coup the EFF Government"
 saf.4.d: "Chaos and confusion has erupted in Pretoria and several other cities across South Africa today, as it appears the recently-elected Economic Freedom Fighters party has been suddenly ousted from power during an assembly session in which many key ANC officials were mysteriously absent from.\n\nAs the opening minutes of the assembly went on, a large congregation of military forces had gathered within the capital, cutting off roads by the usage of armoured vehicles. According to eyewitness reports from inside the assembly, the meeting was reportedly stormed, with one currently-unnamed high ranking official detailing the "constitutional violations" in which the EFF as a whole had committed in it's short period of leadership. Promptly thereafter, all EFF members in attendance were placed under "temporary arrest" in order to sort the situation out later on.\n\nA brief announcement was made following this turn of events, stating that the African National Congress would take the role of acting governing body for the time being. Immediately after this response, furious protests occurred within the capital, with enraged EFF supporters violently clashing with police and military forces. As the previous ANC cabinet begins to regain their positions of leadership, there have been numerous instances of some military leaders and units being largely unresponsive to calls from Pretoria to aid in the stabilization of the urban areas - in addition to large groups of EFF supporters having armed themselves within the countryside and some urban areas. As the chaos continues to expand and the nation continues to unravel, it appears that the populace's worst fears have come to pass, with experts stating that an inner conflict appears imminent."
 saf.4.a: "Power to the People!"
 saf.5.t: "EFF Declare Insurrection"
 saf.5.d: "A state of emergency has been declared in South Africa today as the Economic Freedom Fighters, lead by party president Julius Malema, have declared that they refuse to recognize or legitimize the recently re-elected African National Congress. Not long after this announcement, armed members of the EFF have seized northern areas of the country, declaring a rival government in the countryside, with many members taking up positions in urbanized areas across the country.\n\nThis sudden turn of events has been rapidly building up within the past two weeks since the election, with the EFF claiming that acts of voter restriction have skewed the vote in favour of the "decadent status quo". Due to the highly contested nature of the election, the South African military has been quick to mobilize - however, it appears that many units seem to be unresponsive, with some sources claiming to have defected to the EFF's forces, only complicating the situation tenfold.\n\nFor many, this turn of events was dreaded, if not entirely expected - it seems that the worst case scenario has become the reality for South Africa. With neither side backing down or willing to accept the other's authority, the situation is rapidly spiraling out of control, as violent acts committed by both sides in urban areas and elsewhere only increase in frequency. With no hope for negotiation between the two groups, many experts believe that a conflict is imminent."
 saf.5.a: "For the Unity of South Africa!"
 saf.6.t: "The EFF Win the South African Civil War"
 saf.6.d: "For the past while, the nation of South Africa has been embroiled in a brutal civil war, one which undoubtedly arose from the results of the 2024 elections. Many believed that the nation would eventually collapse altogether into warlordism by the end of it, something of a pattern occurrence in the African continent.\n\nIt seems that those rumours have been proven wrong today. With the collapse of organized resistance from the African National Congress, the Economic Freedom Fighters have announced that they have completely routed their enemies and toppled the old South African regime. With all ANC-aligned forces crippled or destroyed, President Julius Malema has declared total revolutionary victory across the nation, exhibiting pride for all who fought under their banner with liberating fervour. The ANC leadership's fate is unknown, however arrests and less-than-optimal treatment have been rumoured for those who have not fled into exile.\n\nAs much of the country celebrates the collapse of the old government, many more have felt the new government's wrath - executions, brutal reprisals, racially-motivated killings, and harsh treatment of those considered dissidents as well as some of the Boer population have been targeted in the wake of the EFF's victory. Observers believe that such unfortunate acts will continue as the new government attempts to secure the country."
 saf.6.a: "Worrying"
 saf.7.t: "The Military Wins in South Africa"
 saf.7.d: "In a completely unexpected turn of events, rogue forces of the South African National Defence Force that have declared a rival government in Cape Town, have managed to successfully defeat all federal and rebel forces and have are now fortifying their control of the country, eliminating the last pockets of resistance. While it is still unclear what policies this new government will implement, he new head of the SANDF, Carl Laubscher, who has managed to rise through the ranks during the war, has already blamed the civil war on "some questionable pillars in the foundation of our country and the destructive forces that strived to abuse them" and promised payback. Many neighbouring countries have condemned this statement as "undemocratic", while some leaders have reportedly called recent developments in South Africa "an emergency". Only time will tell what influence these events will have over the continent."
 saf.7.a: "Necessity has no law."
 saf.8.t: "Afrikaner Resistance Movement wins in South Africa"
 saf.8.d: "In an absolutely unprecedented turn of events, utilizing the chaos of the civil war and an influx of foreign aid and volunteers, the Afrikaner Resistance Movement has managed to land a defeating blow to every other rival force in the country, which is now at their heel. The newly organized government of the so-called "Volkstaat" has already announced its' plans to completely reorganize the social, political and economic structure of the state in order to "reclaim South Africa for the good of the white race." Many watch in horror as the situation unfolds."

 congo.1.t: "Third Congo War"
 congo.1.d: "Following months of economic turmoil after the oil crisis, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has once again collapsed into an era of warlordism. Following a failed attempt of the opposition group \"Alliance of the Democratic Forces of Congo\" to take power, they have once again taken up arms in the Northeastern region of the nation, vowing to restore order by any means neccessary. Meanwhile, seperatist groups backed by Rwanda in the East have intensified their efforts for independence. In the south, the long tumultuous Katanga region has also seceeded, vying to carve their own future free from the central authority in Kinshasa.\n\nThe DRC, already the 6th poorest nation faces an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe. With millions in the interior dependent on the foreign aid and the export economy for their livlihoods, their lives hang in the balance. Substinance farmers too, face shortages as fighting is expected to destroy large swaths of arable land."
 congo.1.a: "God Save the Congo"
 congo.2.t: "Attempted Coup in the Republic of the Congo"
 congo.2.d: "After weeks of political chaos in the Republic of the Congo as a result of the refugee crisis caused by the Third Congo War, it seems that President Nguesso Congolese Party of Labor has attempted a self coup, attempting to expand executive power in the face of a refugee crisis that threatens to rip the nation apart. As the former dictator of the Popular Republic of the Congo announced the re-establishment of the state almost 30 years after its decline, opposition forces and protesters clashed with military police in the capital.\n\nWith the chaos unfolding in the capital, opposition leaders in the north vowed to restore democracy, whatever the price may be. It seems that now the fate of the two Congos are linked, and a horrible situation in Central Africa has escalated tremendously, with millions of innocents being pulled into a conflict that they did not ask for."
