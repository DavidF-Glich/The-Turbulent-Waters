Now our nation is in great decline and thousands are getting killed and millions upon millions of people are getting displaced!\n\nOur patriots in the traitor-occupied parts of America are getting hunted down and persecuted, and frankly, it's time we pay them with the same coin. We've managed to secure Denver. It's a nice city, but you know what it really lacks? Loyalty. Loyalty, but also Law and Order. We need to bring all of those things here to get things running.\n\nWe are surrounded by insurrections and rebellions. The traitorous imposterous government in Washington DC is getting ready to attack us and end the freedom in this country, so we must prepare and secure a sturdy foothold here, in Denver. For if we don't succeed, America may never become great again!"
 USC_reestablish_civilian_authority: "Reestablish Civilian Authority"
 USC_reestablish_civilian_authority_desc: "Denver, it has become a beacon of light amidst enroaching darkness. We must make sure to maintain constitutional rights and protect our citizens no matter what in spite of the radical threat. Security is important and our soldiers, policemen and militiamen and women are working on it day and night, but keeping a functioning government that is for the people, it's so very important too."
 USC_suspend_habeus_corpus: "Suspend Habeas Corpus" 
 USC_suspend_habeus_corpus_desc: "Our country is in a desperate crisis, one that it has never seen before. Radicalism, terrorism and insurrections have come to our homeland. I declare that all gloves are off when it comes to fighting for the security of our nation. Our federal law enforcement agents will be granted permission to use all available means to detect, arrest and neutralize elements that are dangerous to our country. Habeas Corpus is great, but now is just not the time for it."
 USC_maintain_the_balance: "Maintain the Balance"
 USC_maintain_the_balance_desc: "I think we are the greatest nation and the greatest democracy in history, but only when we all get along, okay? We need strength, but you can only have strength through unity. And I'll try my hardest to be an example of a unifying figure. So whether it's great patriots like Mike Flynn or "Pretty Boy" Rand Paul, hell, even Little Marco Rubio, I won't be speaking out against you, even if there's plenty of talking matter. Now's not the time to talk. We're all in a single boat and we don't want it to sink, do we?"
 USC_mediate_with_the_military: "Mediate With The Military"
 USC_mediate_with_the_military_desc: "I've decided to speak to some of my most loyal followers in the administration and in the military. So Mike comes to me, I ask: "What do we need do to make this country great again?", and he says: "Mr. President, we gotta quit messing around.", that's what he said. And that means we must go big on our enemies both inside and out. He suggested the measures I should take, very appropriate measures for our situation."
 USC_console_the_congress: "Console the Congress"
 USC_console_the_congress_desc: "I have a lot of great friends in the Congress, very good people. Senator Rand Paul called me the other day, he had a lot of great ideas. "Libertarianism" he calls it, I think it could be very good for our country. It's about what America is about: liberty, freedom, business and guns. We should look forward to that as a nation, I think it would be great."
 USC_stabilize_the_remnants: "Stabilize the Remnants"
 USC_stabilize_the_remnants_desc: "You know we got a lot of good people coming to our side, a lot of good people... Working class people, rural folks, city folks from all over the country... They're refugees, that's a terrible word America never knew before, home refugees... Terrible.\n\nWhat we have to do for our nation's survival now is to consolidate every state, every county and every little town, we need to maintain stability, we need to secure Law and Order and help the people.\n\nThey call us the remnants, but we've got a lot of fight left in us. And we'll show 'em."
 USC_unify_the_loyalists: "Unify the Loyalists"
 USC_unify_the_loyalists_desc: "We have a sacred mission of unifying the country again and we will not give up until it is done. We have extended the call to all the patriots concerned with the fate of our country and their response was thunderous.\n\nOur country has never seen a movement like this before - we have people coming from every part of the country, every ethnic and religious group to defend the future of America... It's incredible...\n\n And we have the same message everyone else: stop the bloodshed and reconcile, for those who refuse this message will have to face the united loyalist forces - and let me tell you, they're gonna regret it..."
 USC_appeal_to_heaven: "Appeal To Heaven"
 USC_appeal_to_heaven_desc: "In God We Trust, is one of the mottos our our nation, for God has given us the right to defend ourselves against anyone that tries to wipe us out from the face of Earth."
 USC_fight_the_welfare_state: "Fight the Welfare State"
 USC_fight_the_welfare_state_desc: "Unbelievable! Even in these dire times, we have freeloaders living off welfare, eating up the budget of our country. If we want our country to exist, we can't have it continue this way. We gotta tell 'em: "Get a job!", and that's exactly what I'm gonna do."
 USC_propagate_american_exceptionalism: "Propagate American Exceptionalism"
 USC_propagate_american_exceptionalism_desc: "I've met many people throughout my career, I've been to many countries too, but no other nation and no other person could match the spirit of an American. We have the greatest, smartest and most hard working people the Earth has ever known.\n\nThe world owes us a great debt, and not vice versa. We are the nation of the greatest, most important industrial and technological advancements. We defeated the nazis, we defeated communism and we defeated ISIS. And for the last 75 years or so, we have been carrying the world economy on our back.\n\nWe have given so much to the world, so much... But it's time for America to take care of itself, it's time for "America First"! No more foreign aid and no more wars after we're done with it at home... It's time to help the American people!..."
 USC_appeal_to_order: "Appeal to Order"
 USC_appeal_to_order_desc: "Extremism is tearing our country apart like it has never done before, directly caused by the democratic opposition! Americans are suffering from destruction and marauding while they are simply gaining political points... Nasty people, aren't they?\n\nBut we are not going to let them do it any more than they have. For that reason our law enforcement and our strong and beautiful police have our back... We must Back the Blue and bring back Law and Order to the country while there is still a chance!"
 USC_appeal_to_liberty: "Appeal to Liberty"
 USC_appeal_to_liberty_desc: "Liberty is something we cherish ever since the founding of our nation in 1776, Liberty is a value that we defended time and time again, from the redcoats and their spineless 'loyalists', to the southern seperatists who deprive African-Americans of their right to live as free men, even up to fascists and communists of the last century whose regimes lead to the death of millions. Today, in the 21st century, we must defend it once more from the so called 'Union of America', which serves as nothing more than a glorified warlord state backed by the same globalist billionaries who undermine American democracy as a whole."
 USC_the_refounding_father: "The Refounding Father"
 USC_the_refounding_father_desc: "The known founding fathers of this nation which are, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay and James Madison has created what is today known as the United States of America, now Donald Trump should create a union that is more prosperous and more stable"
 USC_activate_the_defense_production_act: "Activate the Defense Production Act"
 USC_activate_the_defense_production_act_desc: "The Defense Production Act of 1950 is a law that is waiting to be activated ever since the early days of the Cold War, we need to mobilize huge resources in an effort to create new equipment for our troops. While our military industry might not be significant compared to the Union's military industry, we might have to do what it means to match the strength and ability of the Union in the East."
 USC_revive_the_civilian_economy: "Revive the Civilian Economy"
 USC_revive_the_civilian_economy_desc: "Without the civilian economy, the military economy cannot function as well. The civilian economy is esenssial to any economy and we have to kickstart even the "
 USC_defend_american_values: "Defend American Values"
 USC_defend_american_values_desc: "Despite this temporary moment of strife, we were and we will be the greatest nation on the planet. And we must not forget the things that make it great, all those things defined by the words "The American Way of Life", all those things that traitorous elements of the radical left and the radical right are trying to take away from us...\n\nAs your president, I pledge to institutionalise and protect these values and grant any and every citizen of our country the opportunity to live the American Dream!"
 USC_work_with_the_state_governments: "Work With The State Governments"
 USC_work_with_the_state_governments_desc: "Cooperation with state governments would help us legitimize our place in America."
 USC_minimize_militias: "Minimize Militias"
 USC_minimize_militias_desc: "Have you seen those... "militias"? "Boogaloo boys" they call them? Pathetic. Like barely dressed savages running around. Our enemies laugh at them when they are looking at them through their sights, not very funny for us though, not funny at all...\n\nThey're completely disorganized and disobedient! Not up to the standards of training or equipment to protect our country. If you want to do your part, go join the regular military and not whatever this freak show is."
 USC_congressional_contraction: "Congressional Contraction"
 USC_congressional_contraction_desc: "In this time of great peril for this great nation, government must have the ability to execute its functions with swift efficiency. One thing that can block our efficiency in directing the war effort is the conflict between branches of government. Our commander in chief needs all the tools he can get to bring us to victory, which will naturally conflict with Congress. The presidency will pass a few temporary war-time measures to make sure Congress is not too influential and meddling. Their oversight in presidential matters will be reduced, key legal powers revoked, and their overall ability to cause obstructions in decision-making dealt with."
 USC_subdue_subversives: "Subdue Subversives"
 USC_subdue_subversives_desc: "Even though we are confident that many of the loyal patriotic Americans following us are genuine in their loyalty, we must recognize that some are more than meets the eye. There are those within our society and even government offices that harbor hostile and even treasonous motives and agendas. They plot against us, sow disunity or doubt, and conspire to sabotage our efforts for victory; this is all unacceptable and will be dealt with swiftly. Our intelligence and law enforcement agencies will work to apprehend and root out these hostile elements wherever they may be. Whether they be an average citizen or rich representative, their disloyal and treasonous plots and agendas will be eliminated all the same."
 USC_cross_the_rubicon: "Cross the Rubicon"
 USC_cross_the_rubicon_desc: ""
 USC_the_new_stateman: "The New Statesman"
 USC_the_new_stateman_desc: "Donald J. Trump is a cornerstone of this government, hands down. He represents a new type of American politician; a politician not dedicated by establishment corruption but rather fierce patriotism and dedication to his country. This has rightfully landed him as this government's executive and at the start of a new epoch of American politics. He is an American statesman of a new generation of true patriots, and we must all find inspiration and confidence in his place at the top."
 USC_return_to_tradtion: "Return to Tradtion"
 USC_return_to_tradtion_desc: "America has for the long time tolerated the same elements who degraded America's reputation to the world, and it is time to rectify this."
 USC_downsize_the_bureaucracy: "Downsize the Bureaucracy"
 USC_downsize_the_bureaucracy_desc: "The American citizen of today is burdened with more paperwork than ever before in history, times three! The previous democratic administrations have turned our beautiful and effective state apparatus into a bloated version of the European Union. It's not gonna work, you can't do that!\n\nWe will make America convenient and punctual again. How can you say you live in a free country when bureaucracy makes it so you don't have the time to use your freedom?!\n\nSo here's the rule of my administration: if you're a "-crat", you're getting cut, whether it's "plutocrat", "bureaucrat" or "democrat"!"
 USC_oversee_officers: "Oversee the Officers"
 USC_oversee_officers_desc: "As much as the common enlisted man is important on the frontlines, we cannot forget that our officers also serve an important role in this grander fight for victory. This is why their conduct and loyalty must be a point of intense scrutiny. From now on, officers in our armed forces will be held to a higher standard in everything from their training to their sentiments on our leadership and cause. We will not tolerate incompetence, conspiracy, and treason amongst those who have been entrusted to lead our forces to victory on the battlefield."
 USC_minimize_the_military: "Minimize the Military"
 USC_minimize_the_military_desc: "The armed forces of our nation have proven to be a potential threat to the stability and function of this government. This is a very serious issue that we will act swiftly to address. Units will be reassigned or downsized, specific offices will be closed, budgets will be audited, and certain officers who have proven themselves to be a little too troublesome will be dismissed. Under our watchful and dedicated intervention, we will remove any potential conspiratorial elements or anyone that has found themselves with more power than they should have received. This will all hopefully put the military back in their place that they should have been in all along; serving us and this country."
 USC_unite_the_party: "Unite the Party"
 USC_unite_the_party_desc: "The message we must send across the nation is a message of unity and reconciliation. Even our own party consists of so many different people who have different views, who come from different standpoints... And get along surprisingly well. Some call themselves libertarians, some call themselves conservatives or even liberals, but at the end of the day we all fight for a strong and united America, and we won't let anyone, inside or out, tear it apart!"
 USC_liberalize_the_party: "Liberalize the Party"
 USC_liberalize_the_party_desc: "You know what they always say about me, especially the fake news in Washington DC: "Trump is a dictator, Trump is a fascist, he's gonna put everyone in jail"... That's just wrong. In fact, I am probably THE BEST PRESIDENT FOR FREE SPEECH in the history of this country and the fact that they're still allowed to yap is the best confirmation for it."
 USC_the_american_caeser: "The American Caeser"
 USC_the_american_caeser_desc: "The time has come for the accession of a true leader to the seat of true power. The malaise of liberal democracy and its pointless restrictions on the executive will hinder us no more. Donald J. Trump will no longer be just a president, he will be a powerful Caesar; an American Caesar. Under these new powers, he will finally have all the tools to secure peace and prosperity for all of America. Under him we shall be victorious! Ave!"
 USC_end_the_treading: "End the Treading"
 USC_end_the_treading_desc: "\"Don't tread on me\"; that was one of the battle cries of the American revolutionaries in their fight against the tyrannical British Empire, but it was more than just a battle cry. It was a warning to all politicians and leaders of all colors and creeds that liberty is not to be trifled with. We will fulfill this traditional American aspiration by scaling back a lot of government intervention in areas of society and the economy that have caused so many issues for freedom-loving Americans. The state will defend freedom, not tread on it like our treasonous and socialist enemies."
 USC_empower_the_president: "Empower the President"
 USC_empower_the_president_desc: "The presidency of this nation is an office that works best when it has all the needed resources it can get to execute its duties. This is an aim that will be promptly made a reality. The presidency will have its powers and authority on a variety of matters expanded and enforced. Useless bureaucratic rules and hurdles will no longer cause endless delays and waste for the chief executive. With a newly empowered president, this nation will finally get the effective and timely decision-making needed in these trying times."
 USC_empower_the_congress: "Empower the Congress"
 USC_empower_the_congress_desc: "Congress stands as a cornerstone in the functioning of this government and American democracy in general. We must recognize this truth and grant this important part of our republic the powers it desperately needs to conduct its vital duties. Congress will be granted new oversight on a variety of matters within the state along with a reduction of authority and power for other government branches. Under a newly empowered legislative branch, this nation will have both a swift and effective governing body that will guide our country in these turbulent times."
 USC_on_the_back_foot: "On the Back Foot"
 USC_on_the_back_foot_desc: "The enemies are closing in on us. We might find ways for us to put ourselves back on the race to the capital or our efforts to save America will be all for naught."
 USC_empower_the_people: "Empower the People"
 USC_empower_the_people_desc: "Regardless of where one stands regarding the debate on which part of government is important, it all eventually boils down to the role of one group: the people. It is the people of this nation that make us great and give the reason for why this government even exists in the first place. We must delegate more time and resources to hearing the demands of the citizenry over politicians and other high government offices. By empowering the people, we give more legitimacy to both ourselves as leaders and the entire government in the eyes of the citizens."
 USC_mobilize_the_militias: "Mobilize the Militias"
 USC_mobilize_the_militias_desc: "The 1st Amendment has not stopped the deep state from establishing its chokehold on our way of life. Our hope now rests on the 2nd Amendment, especially the militias who are willing to restore our way of life! No amount of bombs and tanks would smoke us out, for as long as we keep our rifles by our side."
 USC_marshal_the_military: "Marshal the Military"
 USC_marshal_the_military_desc: "The so-called Union of America's strength lies with their professional army and a flexible air force. We need to ensure that our capabilities are enough to match or even surpass their forces. Luckily for us we have a good chunk of the army and the rest of the Marines on our side, but we must first ensure that they can effectively engage with our enemies on the ground and on the air."
 USC_desperate_measures: "Desperate Measures"
 USC_desperate_measures_desc: "This war for America has been anything but forgiving for us. We no longer have the luxury of pre-war America's vast military and government resources. Knowing this, every tactic, strategy, and option available to our government and military must be considered. Even though some may call them \"desperate measures\", they will most likely be critical in keeping ourselves in this fight. We must be careful and not waste any time, money, or resources on anything if we want to win this battle for the nation."
 USC_encapture_the_public: "Encapture the Public"
 USC_encapture_the_public_desc: "A major part of waging a successful war that is often overlooked is the level of support from the public. The American people so far seem much less enthusiastic in supporting our cause than we initially expected; this is something that we will immediately change. We will use all the means available to us to rouse and rally the people to our cause. Whether it be stories of outrages committed by our enemies or rallying cries of American patriotic duty, we will capture the minds of the citizenry one way or another. Only when the people are whole-heartedly behind our cause will we succeed in winning this fight for America."
 USC_rehabilitate_the_army: "Rehabilitate the Army"
 USC_rehabilitate_the_army_desc: "In our fight against internal enemies, we may have been a little too excessive when it came to combing our army for such traitors. It is time that we show our due respect and corrections for our undue zealotry. We will closely review officers and personnel that were under previous scrutiny and rehabilitate those who may have been the victim of too much prosecution for suspected disloyalty. Most importantly, we will elevate the army to a position of renewed importance that will hopefully mend any poor sentiments that were instilled within the party or public. Only when our soldiers and officers have renewed faith in us along with confidence that they can conduct their efforts without wasteful intervention will victory become certain."
 USC_army_reorganization: "Army Reorganization"
 USC_army_reorganization_desc: "This war for America has proven itself to require a lot more structural changes than previously anticipated. We must not wait for our enemies, whether it be internal or external, to provoke us to change the composition of our army. Based on what we have seen so far along with currently anticipated threats, we will restructure and reorganize our forces to be fully capable of dealing with all such challenges. We must face and embrace an ultimate truth; a poorly organized and structured army cannot win a modern conflict."
 USC_veteran_mobilization: "Veteran Mobilization"
 USC_veteran_mobilization_desc: "One of the most important assets that we have are not fearsome weapons, rather they are men; our veterans. They hold a wealth of knowledge and experience from previous conflicts that our country has fought in along with being accomplished soldiers in general. We shall enlist them to help in training our army, formulating doctrine, provide a much-needed boost to morale, and even serve in combat roles at the front. With their assistance and participation, our armed forces will become a force to be reckoned with."
 USC_war_plans_department: "War Plans Department"
 USC_war_plans_department_desc: "As much as it would be easy to constantly charge into battle with no forethought, it is something that cannot be done if victory is to be expected. A win on the modern battlefield often requires strong planning beforehand to make it a reality. Knowing this, we will establish a department within our armed forces specifically tasked with drafting up, evaluating, and implementing detailed and effective plans for our war effort. With such an organization at our disposal, we can expect much higher quality plans and preparation for both current and future battles no matter if they are in North America or anywhere else."
 USC_embrace_the_stratocracy: "Embrace the Stratocracy"
 USC_embrace_the_stratocracy_desc: "We are at war, and in war, you cannot run everything in the same way you do as a peacetime liberal democracy. To survive in war, let alone win, the needs and demands of the armed forces come first over the petty desires of the government and population. We must embrace the importance of our military within our government and society at large. They will get everything they need whether it be money, influence, or even positions within the state. Only through stratocracy will we survive to claim victory over our enemies in this battle for America."
 USC_secure_the_party: "Secure the Party"
 USC_secure_the_party_desc: "Even though everyone within the party will publicly claim that are both loyal and devoted, it is most likely not the case. The loyalty of party members to both the cause and President Trump must be immediately secured for more than just the sake of politics. This war effort will require every representative and official within our government to be united under one vision and solidified leadership. Internal dissent, squabbling, and disloyalty will only spell doom for all of us. Any politician or group promoting such problems will be swiftly dealt with."
 USC_rally_the_patriots: "Rally the Patriots"
 USC_rally_the_patriots_desc: "A good chunk of the US Army, the US Marines and the Organized Militias are willing to fight for our beloved nation. It is imperative that we organize ourselves to stand up to the forces of the globalist establishment and other potential enemies."
 USC_lessons_of_war: "Teach the Lessons Of War"
 USC_lessons_of_war_desc: "Those who cannot learn from their mistakes while at war will certainly lose sooner or later. We will not sit idle and allow ourselves to lag behind in a fast-paced environment that is modern warfare. Fortunately for us, this conflict has already given us a lot of lessons and pointers for improvement in almost every way possible. We will waste no time and institutionalize these lessons within our military academies, officers, and general staff to keep our armed forces up to date with everything that could be faced in these uncertain times. Our armed forces will become a lethal force capable of immediately dealing with the harsh circumstances that this conflict is throwing at us."
 USC_mindset_of_struggle: "Spread the Mindset Of Struggle"
 USC_mindset_of_struggle_desc: "This cannot be sugarcoated; America is in the midst of great hardship and suffering. If we are to come out victorious from this turmoil, we must accept the fact that this road to triumph will be a hard one. Everyone from the lowest enlisted soldier to the highest-ranking politician must now embrace a mindset of struggle. We will spread the message of grit, dedication, and toughness throughout every facet of society. America was born through struggle, and it shall be reborn through struggle."
 USC_an_adaptable_army: "An Adaptable Army"
 USC_an_adaptable_army_desc: "Modern warfare is almost like evolution where those who cannot adapt to a rapidly changing battlefield die while those who can go on to continue fighting. We will not allow ourselves to sit idle while our enemies adapt and change. Our armed forces will now embrace a doctrine of tactical flexibility and adaptation. All our officers and generals, no matter how high or low in rank, must embrace whatever tactics, strategy, technology, or change in structure that is needed to get ahead of our enemies. The mantra that will be taught in every unit and officer's post will be this; an adaptable army is an army that goes on to fight another day."
 USC_secure_army_loyalty: "Secure Army Loyalty"
 USC_secure_army_loyalty_desc: "Out of all the factions and players within our government, the army stands as one of the most powerful and influential. Knowing this, no time will be wasted in securing their loyalty. Key officers will be spoken to and won over, appointments made in their favor will be made, and certain outstanding grievances that they have will be immediately addressed. When we know that the army is on our side, then there will be little to fear when it comes to being ousted by overambitious factions within our government or society at large."
 USC_freedom_underground: "Freedom Underground"
 USC_freedom_underground_desc: "Not all warfare is waged with men in identifiable uniform firing at each other in plane sight. To win this war, we must fight it both conventionally and unconventionally. We will organize, direct, and fund patriots to wage their fight for America from the shadows, especially behind enemy lines. Whether it be with special forces, partisans, or insurgents, freedom will be fought for away from the frontlines with dedication and vigor. Even though they may not be easily seen or found, they will carry on fighting an important battle where we are now struggling to do so."
 USC_old_glorys_new_army: "Old Glory's New Army"
 USC_old_glorys_new_army_desc: "The United States of America is a nation with one of the richest histories and traditions around its armed forces. Our country has fought in countless conflicts and has come out triumphant over enemies of all colors and creeds. We will proudly continue this glorious heritage. It will be certain that every branch, unit, and office will honorably continue the traditions and legacies of America's past. Even though the times and camouflage patterns have changed, the spirit and tradition of American might will be continued through us."
 USC_take_back_our_country: "Take Back Our Country"
 USC_take_back_our_country_desc: "America is now in chaos. The entrenched elites and other treasonous elements of society have thrown this once great nation into turmoil, but not all is doom and gloom. Now is the time for the true patriots of America to take charge and face our enemies. We will marshal every government body, resource, private enterprise, and patriot that wishes to fight this glorious battle with us. Under our banner, America will be taken back from these traitors!"
 USC_drain_the_swamp: "Drain the Swamp"
 USC_drain_the_swamp_desc: "Not all of America's enemies make their intent extremely obvious. A mess of corrupt establishment politicians and bureaucrats are sucking away resources and manpower from not just our government, but from the people too. We will no longer tolerate any of this. Our government will be swiftly cleaned up from these wasteful and corrupt actors. Offices will be closed, budgets will be reevaluated, and people will certainly be fired. Just as Trump said countless times on the campaign trail, we will \"drain the swamp\"."
 USC_create_the_nida: "The Eye Of Providence"
 USC_create_the_nida_desc: "In our effort to muster as much of America's political and military assets, we have been able to successfully seize a sizable portion of pre-war America's intelligence apparatus. The intelligence agencies of this country are second to none and have information-gathering tools and skills that are unprecedented in their reach and sophistication. Under our own dedicated agency, the National Defense Intelligence Agency, we will put all these assets to use and quickly close the gap or even overtake our enemies in information and intelligence gathering. However, we must tread lightly, as their skills and clandestine nature may hide sinister machinations that could cause a lot of issues for us in the future."
 USC_work_with_the_old_party: "Work With The Old Party"
 USC_work_with_the_old_party_desc: "Not everyone within our government shares the same exact vision for how things should be done. Members of the Republican Party who are a bit different in their ways of doing things are still a sizable portion of this government. However, instead of sidelining them, we will sit down and negotiate with them. Maintaining political unity within this government can only be achieved if their cooperation and support is secured. It would be a mistake for us to alienate such an influential part of this government in this time of crisis we find ourselves in."
 USC_end_of_the_line: "End Of The Line"
 USC_end_of_the_line_desc: ""
 USC_restart_the_war_machine: "Restart the War Machine"
 USC_restart_the_war_machine_desc: "One of America's greatest strengths was its expansive military-industrial complex. The fruits of America's military industry won us two world wars and kept us at the top for the rest of the twentieth century. This fearsome machine will be resurrected and put to use in our march to victory. Factories will be opened, production lines restarted, and workers will be employed in putting together the most fearsome weapons of war. When this expansive industry of war reaches its maximum capacity, our military will become an inexhaustible force that nobody on this continent can fathom to stop."
 USC_encourage_domestic_production: "Encourage Domestic Production"
 USC_encourage_domestic_production_desc: "A massive mistake that pre-war American politicians made were the condoning of the domination of foreign companies and imported goods in our economy. Under such a corrupt globalist economic arrangement, our domestic manufacturing base rotted away. We will no longer allow this to continue. We will publicly call for and encourage, either through financial or political means, the support and use of domestic manufacturing. When all our manufactured goods and services are made by our own firms, then we will be safe knowing that we will be completely beholden to nobody. A powerful America runs on a powerful all-American industry."
 USC_economic_expansionism: "Economic Expansionism"
 USC_economic_expansionism_desc: "For an economy to grow, the major enterprises that contribute to economic activity need to grow as well. We will identify specific entities, both big and small, that are important to the economy and give them financial and political incentives to expand their activities. Once they all grow in size and scope, they will certainly employ more people and contribute more to the economy."
 USC_fiscal_responsibility: "Fiscal Responsibility"
 USC_fiscal_responsibility_desc: "One of the worst failures of the pre-war American state was their totally irresponsible handling of government spending. Before the war, deficits were high, the national debt was spiraling out of control, and spending was unnecessarily exorbitant. We will not make the same mistake. We will now institute specific regulations and procedures to ensure that our government spending remains manageable and our debt low. In times like these, being wasteful and irresponsible with state finances can be devastating, as seen with what happened to pre-war America."
 USC_ease_taxpayer_burdens: "Ease Taxpayer Burdens"
 USC_ease_taxpayer_burdens_desc: "One of the most unjust policies inflicted on almost every American citizen were the ridiculously high taxes in prewar America. This ongoing war has caused even more financial problems for the American people; we must not add on it. An immediate and broad tax cut for a large swath of American taxpayers will be instituted. Hopefully, this will ease some of the massive financial burdens caused by not just the war, but also by the excessive and poor financial decisions of the pre-war government."
 USC_encourage_the_working_man: "Encourage the Working Man"
 USC_encourage_the_working_man_desc: "The average American will not simply make miracles by being told to do so; we need to do more than that. Regular citizens need a tangible incentive to work and contribute to this economy. By providing incentives, whether it be through financial stipends or new job opportunities, we can count on our citizens to be more willing and able to play their part in growing the economy. People having good paying jobs and tangible fruits of such labor are the best indicators of an improving economy."
 USC_destroy_chinese_imports: "Destroy Chinese Imports"
 USC_destroy_chinese_imports_desc: "It is not hard to understand that China has been anything but friendly to us. For years they have been working to undermine and overtake us in almost every field namable, yet we still import their goods to their benefit. This terrible status quo will end now. We will sharply increase tariffs and general restrictions on the import of Chinese goods. Along with this, Chinese goods already imported into the US that fail to meet new regulations will be promptly destroyed. The days of being reliant on our communist adversary will soon become a distant memory."
 USC_resurrect_the_dream: "Resurrect the Dream"
 USC_resurrect_the_dream_desc: "America was once the land of great promise, where men from the most horrid poverty could come, make a living, and find success. This was an America that was lost, but not anymore. We will work to bring back the opportunities that made America a nation that made so many dreams come true. Through new work programs, grants, and other legal or economic reforms, the people will once again find a clear path to success. When we resurrect the American dream, we will be certain that America has been made great again."
 USC_expand_arms_production: "Expand Arms Production"
 USC_expand_arms_production_desc: "Like all wars, victory can only come when men have arms to fight with in the first place. The current pace of this conflict is drastically affecting our ready supply of small arms for our army. However, we will not sit by and let this situation deteriorate further. We will immediately reach out to our foremost small arms manufacturers and invest more material and money into expanded weapons production. Whether it be assault rifles or machine guns, our soldiers will get what they need to win this war."
 USC_support_rural_farmers: "Support Rural Farmers"
 USC_support_rural_farmers_desc: "The rural farmer of this country is suffering from the worst neglect out of all demographics of the American population. Crushed by globalism, coastal elites, and imports by China; they have been left to rot. This terrible neglect will end under our watch. We will immediately provide investment for modernized farming equipment, poverty relief, and expanded agricultural production. Once conditions for farmers improve dramatically, we can expect greater food security for the population along with some long-awaited revitalization of rural communities."
 USC_a_gun_in_every_hand: "A Gun in Every Hand"
 USC_a_gun_in_every_hand_desc: "This war will not be won with simply having "enough" weapons; we need more than that. Our military-industrial base and logistic networks must immediately begin increasing the supply of arms to our forces at the forefront of this war. Every man in uniform in whichever branch needs a comfortable supply or arms and ammunition. Outdoing our enemies in available weapons will give us an immediate and noticeable leg-up on the battlefield."
 USC_promote_economic_patriotism: "Promote Economic Patriotism"
 USC_promote_economic_patriotism_desc: "An important area that Americans can show some patriotism is through their wallets. We will begin publicly advocating for all Americans to only do business with American enterprises. Why should citizens who live in a nation as bountiful and rich as America need to do business with anyone else? Whether it be buying, selling, or investing, citizens and firms should show some patriotic loyalty to their country over destructive impulses to go with foreigners."
 USC_establish_an_all_american_banking_system: "Establish an All-American Banking System"
 USC_establish_an_all_american_banking_system_desc: "America's banking system is dominated by a lot of foreign owned and even operated banks who have a lot of influence on our economy. It is time to end this embarrassing situation. We will establish a new banking system that heavily favors American owned and operated banks over foreign ones. Along with this, we will enact new regulations that target foreign banks to make it hard for them to establish financial hegemony over our country. America's money should only be in the hands of Americans and nobody else."
 USC_crush_the_federal_reserve: "Crush the Federal Reserve"
 USC_crush_the_federal_reserve_desc: "The Federal Reserve was one of the most blatant examples of federal government overreach in the American economy. However, after today, they will no longer be so intrusive into the economic activities of this country. Under new executive orders and reforms, the Federal Reserve will be swiftly downsized and stripped of their powers. This will not be hidden; we will have them regulated and restructured into oblivion."
 USC_employ_our_veterans: "Employ Our Veterans"
 USC_employ_our_veterans_desc: "Our veterans possess a lot of valuable skills from their time in the military; this is something we cannot allow to go to waste. We shall promptly open new job opportunities for them both in our civilian and military sectors where they can apply their skills. With our veterans in the workforce, they can hopefully use their skills, discipline, and experience to boost the productivity and efficiency of a variety of major enterprises critical to the war effort."
 USC_recruit_our_veterans: "Recruit Our Veterans"
 USC_recruit_our_veterans_desc: "Our veterans possess a wealth of important skills from their extensive training and service as soldiers; this is something we cannot allow to go to waste. We will recruit many of our veterans to serve in combat roles across multiple branches of our armed forces. Their combat experience, skills, and extensive knowledge obtained during their time in the military will serve as an extremely valuable asset for our troops at the front."
 USC_next_generation_logistics: "Next Generation Logistics"
 USC_next_generation_logistics_desc: "An often-overlooked part of winning war is logistics. If our soldiers do not get the supplies they need to fight, then how can they win the battle? This is an issue that will be immediately addressed. We will begin a massive program of investment to expand, modernize, and even innovate our logistics network. Roads will be built, new rail networks laid down, new routes will be planned for supply distribution, along with other major changes and upgrades. The era of our armed forces worrying about available supplies will become a thing of the past."
 USC_a_deal_they_cant_refuse: "A Deal They Can't Refuse"
 USC_a_deal_they_cant_refuse_desc: "During times of great crisis, such as the one we find ourselves in, time and resources cannot be spared for the luxuries of haggling or negotiating with private enterprises. Our military-industrial base must now know that we are not here to negotiate, bargain, or make extravagant deals with them; we are demanding results and nothing more. The major firms involved in our arms production will be immediately "contracted" to manufacture the weapon systems that we need. If they refuse, stall, or try to waste our time or resources, they will learn that there are consequences for such chicanery."
 USC_the_business_of_war: "The Business of War"
 USC_the_business_of_war_desc: "Like all other aspects of human society, war is overwhelmingly conducted with the help of private enterprise. We will begin the process of contracting out a variety of firms to manufacture many important weapon systems that our armed forces desperately need. Even though it may take a little time to arrange the logistics, planning, and the resolution of any issues with the manufacturers, it will all eventually pay off. When we establish proper coordination and collaboration with our defense contractors, we will feel comfortable knowing that they will be up to the challenge of giving us whatever we need to fight this war."
 USC_fight_the_great_american_struggle: "Fight the Great American Struggle"
 USC_fight_the_great_american_struggle_desc: "The war that we are currently fighting in is no ordinary conflict. It is a war unseen in centuries of American history; it is a war for the destiny of America itself. To win will require struggle and a will to fight on the part of every loyal patriot from the regular factory worker to the highest-ranking officers in our military. In fighting this great American struggle, every man, woman, child, social group, and firm must be ready to fight and give everything for victory."
 USC_revitalize_forgotten_communities: "Revitalize Forgotten Communities"
 USC_revitalize_forgotten_communities_desc: "The deindustrialization of America and the concentration of wealth in Liberal coastal cities have wreaked havoc on many hardworking American communities. We will spare no time in addressing this grave injustice inflicted upon American society. Communities and locales that are economically struggling will receive investment and job opportunities both from the state and private enterprises that we will partner with. When these left-behind communities finally receive good paying jobs and a sense of economic security, then they will begin to thrive as all of American society should be."
 USC_introduce_rationing: "Introduce Rationing"
 USC_introduce_rationing_desc: "Unfortunately for the average American citizen, the era of undisturbed plenty is temporarily over. Due to the turbulent and intense conditions of the war, many key staples of daily life are in short supply. To carefully manage and reduce waste of such key staples and supplies, rationing will be introduced. Citizens will be allowed to purchase a limited number of specific items every month and will have state-issued documentation to track and record their purchases. Hopefully, if we conserve and manage our resources well enough, we can win this war without encountering crippling shortages that have destroyed many states in countless wars of the past."
 USC_build_anti_poverty_encampments: "Build Anti-Poverty Encampments"
 USC_build_anti_poverty_encampments_desc: "The economic fallout caused by the civil war has thrown countless Americans into vicious poverty. However, we will not allow this suffering to continue undisturbed. A broad but comprehensive aide program for Americans living in the worst conditions will be implemented. These Americans, who are often cold, hungry, sick, homeless, or all the above, will receive aide ranging from food donations to temporary places to live. If we keep our citizens' standard of living from degrading significantly, then we can expect morale and support for the war to remain high."
 USC_end_green_tyranny: "End Green Tyranny"
 USC_end_green_tyranny_desc: "For years, liberal elites have been trying to shove \"green energy\" down the throats of the American people. Their schemes have threatened to put millions of Americans who work in the coal and oil industries out of work. This will no longer be tolerated as the \"green\" industries that were artificially supported by these socialists on the coast will have any privilege or stipend given by the pre-war government revoked. New financial aid and reinvestment into America's fossil fuel industries will be swiftly approved to make sure that the millions of Americans who work in such industries stay at work. We are no longer beholden to liberal coastal elites and their social justice NGO lackeys, so why should we give any support to their bizarre \"environmentalist\" schemes anyway?"
 USC_embrace_the_energy_of_the_future: "Embrace the Energy Of The Future"
 USC_embrace_the_energy_of_the_future_desc: "As much as we feel complacent with the current makeup of our energy sector, we must recognize that the modern world we currently live in is moving faster than our pride and nostalgia. New advancements in the energy sector are promising a lot of benefits that we could use to great effect. New breakthroughs that have been pioneered by American firms and scientists in areas like nuclear, geothermal, and solar energy are ripe for implementation and exploitation. We shall waste no time and immediately grant funding and support for new energy projects that utilize these new technologies. America is a land of innovation and progress, and we will continue to fulfill this age-old promise with the embracing of these new energy technologies of the future."
 USC_expand_the_defense_production_act: "Expand the Defense Production Act"
 USC_expand_the_defense_production_act_desc: "The Defense Production Act is undoubtably a useful tool for us to coordinate and mobilize our military industry, but this war has proven that we need more than what this current iteration of the law offers. Knowing this, the powers and authorities granted by the act will be updated and expanded significantly. Our government will now have even more tools and oversight to coordinate, control, and expand production of key military equipment needed for the war effort. With these bureaucratic restrictions finally lifted, victory will soon be within our grasp."
 USC_regrow_american_innovation: "Regrow American Innovation"
 USC_regrow_american_innovation_desc: "America was once the world's best in science. This nation both fathered and invited the brightest minds of whole generations who went on to create groundbreaking inventions and innovations. We will make sure to live up to this great heritage. Effective immediately, new grants and investments will be given to major private and public firms involved in scientific research and development. Once we invest enough resources and money, our nation's capacity for innovation in science and technology will become unrivalled; just as we were destined to be."
 USC_the_best_is_yet_to_come: "The Best Is Yet To Come"
 USC_the_best_is_yet_to_come_desc: "We have worked so hard and come so far in our battle for retaking this country, but it does not end here. There is still so much more ahead of us in our quest to make America great again. As much as we may want to stop now, there is so much to continue fighting and struggling for. Our enemies even now continue in their effort to destroy America and the patriots defending it, but they will not stop us. As president Trump once said, \"the best is yet to come\"."
 USC_economic_populism: "Economic Populism"
 USC_economic_populism_desc: "The economic problems of our country cannot be understood by some elitist liberal academics. Only the common people of this country understand what needs to be done with the American economy. Being the people who represent them, we shall promptly listen to their demands. New policies and reforms regarding the economy will be based off what is popular with voters and the citizenry. If we listen to them and give them what they want, then we shall never go wrong in their eyes. We are a democracy after all, and listening to the will of the people is what we are supposed to do."
 USC_utilize_revolutionary_nostalgia: "Utilize Revolutionary Nostalgia"
 USC_utilize_revolutionary_nostalgia_desc: "America was a nation born through a violent struggle for freedom. This is a legacy we will fully embrace and utilize to its fullest extent in our public relations campaigns. Everywhere that we promote our cause will be a moment where we invoke the American revolutionaries. The patriots that fought against tyranny then will be used as a model for the patriots of now. America's revolutionary past will be the bedrock that motivates our own revolutionary struggle of today."
 USC_invoke_the_second_ammendment: "Invoke the Second Amendment"
 USC_invoke_the_second_ammendment_desc: "The second amendment of our constitution is one of the cornerstones of America's democracy, but unfortunately, many do not share our sentiments. Our enemies tried to deprive so many Americans of their right to bear arms, only proving what so many were suspecting. This right must now become a rallying cry for all loyal patriots who wish to defend their constitutional rights from tyranny. In our public campaigns we will invoke the importance of the second amendment as the ultimate weapon that everyday Americans have in the defense of this nation. We will make our citizens proud and motivated to fight knowing that their rights are on the line in this war."
 USC_the_national_militia: "The National Militia"
 USC_the_national_militia_desc: "The militias that have been raised to fight alongside our regular forces are a great benefit to us, but their disjointed nature might pose an issue in the future. Therefore, we will create a singular national militia that will be under much closer control from our military high command. This new national militia will combine the grit and patriotism of the common citizenry with the more organized and centralized nature of our military command structure. Just as the American revolutionaries fought the British with citizen militias, we too shall defeat our enemies of today with citizens fighting in a militia."
 USC_stand_your_ground: "Stand Your Ground"
 USC_stand_your_ground_desc: "This war has unfortunately inflicted a lot of our citizens, soldiers, and politicians alike with a doom and gloom mindset. There is talk of retreat, capitulation, and imminent destruction by so many, but all this cowardly talk needs to end. Our commanders and soldiers will be instructed that only when they stand their ground and fight will victory become possible. When we stand and fight instead of cowering in fear, our enemies will know that they will be in for a world of pain. This is a mindset that everyone from the regular enlisted man to the highest politician must embrace with pride and vigor."
 USC_armor_innovations: "Armor Innovations"
 USC_armor_innovations_desc: "Our current combat experience fighting this conflict has given us a wealth of knowledge and lessons to use for improving our weapon systems. This is something especially true for our armored forces. We will use everything we have seen and learned with the use of tanks in this war and have our military industry's R&D departments begin work on upgrades and other improvements. With these new technologies and innovations at our disposal, our armored forces will become a force to be reckoned with on the modern battlefield."
 USC_reorganize_the_air_force: "Reorganize the Air Force"
 USC_reorganize_the_air_force_desc: "In our attempt to seize what we can of pre-war America's armed forces, we have obtained a large swath of the Air Force. However, in the ensuing chaos of the war, our attempt to put together an air force from these seized assets has been haphazard and unorganized at best. This is a situation that will be rectified immediately. Our air force will be reorganized and restructured significantly with new air wings, restructured units, new air bases, and new doctrines set. Once we get our military aviation in full working order, we will be ruling the skies over America."
 USC_crush_the_deepstate: "Crush the Deepstate"
 USC_crush_the_deepstate_desc: "The sinister clandestine forces of the deepstate have been working against us since day one, often through America's intelligence agencies. Even though some of these intelligence-gathering bodies and operatives now fall under our control, we will finally show these treasonous elements who is the boss around here. Their powers will be drastically cut back and their activities will now be under much stricter oversight from the regular government. If they want to do anything, they will have to run it through us first. The deepstate and their lackeys will no longer assail the true patriots of this country ever again!"
 USC_restructure_the_intel_community: "Restructure the IC"
 USC_restructure_the_intel_community_desc: "The intelligence agencies and operatives that have been secured from pre-war America have proven to be most useful so far, but there is still much more room for improvement. The current threats and pressures from this war and other areas of concern warrant a serious restructuring of our intelligence community. They will receive new assignments, new priorities, and have a variety of their offices reorganized for new objectives. Our newly reorganized intelligence-collecting agencies will leave our enemies with nothing to hide from us."
 USC_trial_the_traitors: "Trial the Traitors"
 USC_trial_the_traitors_desc: "In our fight for America, we have come across many Americans who claim to be fighting for freedom and this nation's salvation, but we have swiftly learned that they are the total opposite. Many of these so-called patriots are traitors, opportunists, liars, and fanatics of disgusting ideologies that have no place in this country. Now is the time to enact justice on these disgusting traitors of America. They will be put on trial, judged for their criminal actions against this nation and its people, and be punished accordingly. Even though we do not have all the traitors in this country in our custody now, the ones we do have will know justice for all their crimes."
 USC_back_the_blue: "Back the Blue"
 USC_back_the_blue_desc: "The police forces of this nation have borne one of the greatest burdens out of anyone in this country in the last few years; keeping law and order on America's streets. Anarchists, criminals, terrorists, and finally the turbulence of this war have made the lives of our police officers a living hell. However, we will no longer allow this torment to continue. Our local, state, and federal law enforcement officers will finally get the support that they need. Whether it be money, equipment, or new training programs, they will receive whatever is required for them to secure peace and order for our society."
 USC_rekindle_nationalism: "Rekindle Nationalism"
 USC_rekindle_nationalism_desc: "To save one's country, one must have a love and appreciation for what makes their nation special. The patriots that are fighting for this country must be motivated with more than just the idea of victory; they must be motivated for the defense of the American identity itself. In our public campaigns for the war effort, we will spread nationalistic pride and fervor for the American nation. Nationalism will no longer be the scary phrase that Americans will be punished for using; it will instead by the main force that motivates everyone."
 USC_the_minutemens_last_stand: "The Minutemens' Last Stand"
 USC_the_minutemens_last_stand_desc: "The militias and other more unorganized forces fighting for us are now in a very precarious spot. As the pressures and losses inflicted by the war mount, they will need to take a more active role in fighting our enemies at the front. It will not be easy for them, but desperate times call for desperate measures. However, we do not doubt their abilities and devotion to our cause. We are confident that they will do their best in defending this country and carrying us to victory wherever possible."
 USC_spacious_skies: "Spacious Skies"
 USC_spacious_skies_desc: "As much as fighters and the intense combat around their use gets all the attention, winning the air war will need more than just using fighters and ground-attack aircraft. We will need to construct more and increase our use of tactical and strategic bombers that can hit targets deep behind enemy lines. Once we use them to cripple enemy infrastructure, industry, logistics, and other critical behind-the-lines targets, we can expect enemy combat efficacy to be greatly reduced. Not only will we rule the skies over us, but over our enemies as well."
 USC_finance_plane_production: "Finance Plane Production"
 USC_finance_plane_production_desc: "Our current rate of combat losses in the air is putting a lot of pressure on our air force. To keep our air force in action, we will need to obtain more aircraft to replace losses and expand the efficacy of our air wings. We will waste no time and fund our manufacturers to begin mass producing more combat aircraft. Our air force will soon recieve the vehicles they need to keep us fighting in the air war over America."
 USC_the_next_generation_air_force: "The Next Generation Force"
 USC_the_next_generation_air_force_desc: "Military aviation technology is accelerating every year at a faster and faster pace. Knowing this, we must not be left behind in this race for the next advanced air force. We will accumulate and organize all the progress, material, and know-how to create a "next generation" air force. This force will combine the latest in tactics and technology to make us unrivaled on this continent, and maybe even the world. Just as pre-war America led the way in military aviation, we too shall lead in advancing such a field for the foreseeable future."
 USC_aerial_recruitment_drive: "Aerial Recruitment Drive"
 USC_aerial_recruitment_drive_desc: "Even though we may have a good number of aircraft, we still need people to operate them. Seeing that we have a shortage of pilots, we will start a new recruitment drive to induct more into our air force. We will advertise to the population that with the air force they can find good career opportunities, attractive salaries, and most importantly, the fulfilment of their patriotic duties. Hopefully, this new campaign for recruitment will bring in plenty of dedicated Americans willing to fly and fight for their good of their nation."
 USC_bolster_the_national_guard: "Bolster the National Guard"
 USC_bolster_the_national_guard_desc: "The National Guard of this country has proven themselves throughout American history to be a capable force in defending domestic peace and tranquility. In these turbulent times we find ourselves in where war, civil unrest, rioting, crime, and other acts of domestic terror rock our entire society, the national guard can serve as another effective force to secure order. We will begin investing more manpower, funds, training, and equipment into our national guard units both fighting at the front and securing order at home. With a bolstered national guard, we can consider the terror and anarchy that have recently struck American society to be a permanent thing of the past."
 USC_empower_the_executive_branch: "Empower the Executive Branch"
 USC_empower_the_executive_branch_desc: "For many years the executive branch was overshadowed by the Deep State. They were taking away priveleges, they were making this role into a puppet, a public clown to say whatever they put on the paper so they could rule from behind the curtain!\n\nIt's time we put an end to this. In the most difficult times of our country, it was the president and the executive branch that made the roughest but most needed decisions that allowed us to make it through any crisis so far. This presidency was also not without challenge... but also not without glory and heroism. And I think many people working beside me right now are heroes...\n\nAmerica has given us an unprecedented and powerful mandate to bring change to this country. And I know we can provide it the necessary leadership. I will not falter until we deliver a strong, beautiful and safe America for generations to come!"
 USC_realign_the_congress: "Realign the Congress"
 USC_realign_the_congress_desc: "The Congress... you know we never had our way with the Congress, they never wanted to pass our legislation without causing trouble, without all these scandals. Things could have been much easier, in fact, maybe we wouldn't be having this thing called "Civil War"...\n\nBut now, thankfully, we've managed to drain the swamp. Now people... who are real people, who are real patriots.. can finally raise their heads and truly work for their country.\n\nI know a lot of great people in the congress. We've got Mike Johnson, he's doing a terrific job as speaker... Matt Gaetz, of course, wonderful guy, true patriot, very loyal to his country... We need more people like them.\n\nNow this is a congress I can make a deal with, alright. They're smart enough not to refuse that deal, especially during the hardships our country has to go through."
 USC_enact_wartime_austerity: "Enact Wartime Austerity"
 USC_enact_wartime_austerity_desc: "An area that this war has put a lot of stress on that is not discussed as much is this government's budget. A lot of funds are being diverted to the war effort, leaving us with very limited room for spending on other areas. To keep this government's spending and debt from spiraling out of control, we will enact wartime financial austerity measures. Spending on a variety of programs deemed non-essential will be drastically cut along with hard spending limits being implemented across the board. Even though these changes will no doubt cause discontent and anger with some, it is totally necessary if we want to win this war and keep our finances in solid condition."
 USC_a_list_weaponry_agreements: "A-List Weaponry Agreements"
 USC_a_list_weaponry_agreements_desc: "If there is anything that we have learned from this conflict, it is that modern warfare cannot be won with antiquated and simplistic weapons. We will only be able to secure victory if we have the most advanced and newest weapon systems available on the market. We need weapons that are pinpoint accurate, highly efficient, and unrivaled in technological sophistication. Knowing this, we will immediately reach out to our premier defense contractors to secure the manufacturing of the most advanced weapon systems that they can possibly make. Once we have settled agreements for new contracts, our enemies will be dumbstruck with the combat efficiency of our military hardware."
 USC_support_wartime_entrepreneurs: "Support Wartime Entrepreneurs"
 USC_support_wartime_entrepreneurs_desc: "Unlike many other nations, a lot of our military industry is run by private companies and individual entrepreneurs. Many of these businessmen who run these companies have a lot on the line with investing in our armed forces in turbulent times like these. To keep them in business and supplying us with arms, we will provide generous financial and material assistance. Whether it be direct cash investment, grants for new equipment, or better terms with new contracts, we shall make their lives easier so they can make conducting the war easier."
 USC_harness_the_military_industrial_complex: "Harness the Military Industrial Complex"
 USC_harness_the_military_industrial_complex_desc: "America's military industrial complex is an unrivaled force of productive capability. No other nation can come close to the industrial capacity and quality that American firms achieve. Even though we do not posses all of America's pre-war military industry, we will still harness every bit of what we have to the maximum possible extent. We will organize and direct our military industrial complex to produce the most they can at the highest level of quality and efficiency. Victory will be certain when we unleash the full might of our industry's productive capabilities."
 USC_lockheed_martin_contracts: "Lockheed Martin Contracts"
 USC_lockheed_martin_contracts_desc: "Lockheed Martin is one of America's premier aircraft manufacturers and have achieved extensive success with their products both with the pre-war government and many other nations around the world. Knowing this, we will reach out and contract them to begin production of new aircraft for our air force. With their talent and machines at our disposal, we will finally have the effective means to achieve total domination of America's air space."
 USC_gdls_contracts: "GDLS Contracts"
 USC_gdls_contracts_desc: "General Dynamics Land Systems is one of America's premier armored vehicle manufacturers and have achieved extensive success with their products both with the pre-war government and many other nations around the world. Knowing this, we will reach out and contract them to begin production of new ground vehicles for our army. With their talent and machines at our disposal, we will finally give our army the capabilities to dominate every ground engagement with lethal efficiency and precision."
 USC_stop_tyrannical_regulation: "Stop Tyrannical Regulation"
 USC_stop_tyrannical_regulation_desc: "Government regulation of the economy has consistently proven itself to be one of the biggest obstructors of economic growth and freedom in this country. We will not allow intrusive regulation to further strangle the lives of Americans and their private interests. The most obstructive regulations and other bureaucratic red tape will be swiftly repealed either through executive order or new legislation. Once we have gutted all these suffocating regulations and laws, our economy will finally get the chance to expand and grow without interference."
 USC_inflation_annihilation: "Inflation Annihilation"
 USC_inflation_annihilation_desc: "One of the most worrying economic issues afflicting this country in the last few years is inflation. The decreasing value of the dollar is affecting both the overall health of the economy and the daily lives of hardworking Americans. One can look at the countless examples in history to see just how destructive inflation can be for the economic health of a nation. We will not allow inflation to ruin the finances of American citizens and their businesses. The interest rates given by our government will be carefully adjusted and monitored along with stricter controls of the printing of new currency. With careful attention and control, inflation will become a concern of the past."
 USC_privatize_public_sector_services: "Privatize Public Sector Services"
 USC_privatize_public_sector_services_desc: "Our government spends a lot of money on running and upkeeping a variety of wasteful services and companies. This all saps a large quantity of manpower, money, and energy from our government. In keeping with our commitment to reduce state influence in the economy, many of these services will be immediately privatized. When we finally sell off these services and enterprises to private entities, more money and resources can be allocated for more useful purposes within our government."
 USC_constitutionalize_capitalism: "Constitutionalize Capitalism"
 USC_constitutionalize_capitalism_desc: "The constitution of our nation, a political document that enshrines government restraint, personal freedoms, and separation of powers, must also serve as a guiding force within our economy. The principles enshrined in our founding document will be thoroughly promoted and pushed within every segment of our nation's private sector. Not only will we advocate for this, but we will also enact new regulations and legislation that will encode into law our drive to constitutionalize the economy of this country. We will have all of America embrace the founding philosophies of our unique political heritage."
 USC_ensure_congressional_transparency: "Ensure Congressional Transparency"
 USC_ensure_congressional_transparency_desc: "In our desired effort to reduce the encroaching power of the state, the first major step that can be taken is to improve the transparency of our government institutions, with the first we shall address being Congress. When Congress is transparent to the people with its activities, trust is built and any attempts by politicians to unfairly accumulate power will be exposed for all to see. We shall immediately make a variety of Congressional procedures publicly viewable and have key activities once conducted clandestinely published publicly. We shall take this mantra to heart; a government that cannot hide anything cannot oppress anything."
 USC_begin_transformation: "Begin Transformation"
 USC_begin_transformation_desc: "Now that we have established our intent to reform the power dynamic between the government and citizens, it is time we begin the transition to that point. Our political and legal framework will immediately be reformed in preparation for this planned transition. Certain powers, rules, and regulations often exercised by the federal government will be relaxed and transferred over to the lower levels of government authority, such as the states or local government. There will also be an overall reduction in the size of certain federal agencies and their scope of intervention and regulation. With these new measures, we will get closer to our goal of reducing wasteful and undemocratic government intervention in American society."
 USC_shark_tank_initiative: "Shark Tank Initiative"
 USC_shark_tank_initiative_desc: "In capitalism, only the best companies with the best products and services survive while those who cannot go out of business. This is a truth that will be thoroughly embraced. In our plan for rebuilding and growing the economy, we will take a novel approach in choosing which firms to work with. We will examine which companies offer the best products, services, cost savings, and efficiency as enterprises with newer and much stricter standards. They will compete with other firms in the running and the ones that outperform everyone else will be selected for new projects or further investment. Under this new initiative, we will be bound to be only left with the best of the best for our future business partners in building a new America."
 USC_trimming_the_bureaucratic_fat: "Trimming the Bureaucratic Fat"
 USC_trimming_the_bureaucratic_fat_desc: "The US has been notorious for its unbelievable level of bureaucratic bloat and waste. Millions of dollars and hours of work have been lost in the red tape and byzantine structuring of this government. However, now is the time for us to end this waste and turn our government into an efficient machine of productivity. We will immediately begin a comprehensive restructuring effort by firing bureaucrats working in useless positions, reducing budgets for wasteful programs, reducing the size of bloated agencies, and enacting strict evaluations of all pending program budget requests. The era of wasteful big government ends now!"
 USC_state_power_reborn: "State Power Reborn"
 USC_state_power_reborn_desc: "The states have always been an important part of America's decentralization of power. We must cement our commitment to decentralization by granting new powers to state governments. The states will be given a whole new set of authority on their own matters while the federal government will have their jurisdiction over the states greatly reduced. Under this new arrangement, the states will finally get their duly needed autonomy and a break from a previously intrusive federal government."
 USC_equality_in_taxation: "Equality in Taxation"
 USC_equality_in_taxation_desc: "Taxation has always been an extremely problematic question in the issue of the government versus the citizen. The pre-war American government led an unfair and discriminatory taxation system that targeted wealthy Americans simply on the grounds that they did well financially. This will no longer continue as we eliminate any major differences in taxation rates regarding income or wealth. The people of this country will all be taxed equally, regardless of where you are on the economic ladder."
 USC_patriotism_in_dissent: "Patriotism in Dissent"
 USC_patriotism_in_dissent_desc: "As much as our enemies will keep regurgitating like madmen that we are an all-mighty and all controlling institutionalized force, it is simply a crazed fantasy. The devoted patriots of this country have spent their recent years constantly battling traitors, establishment opportunists, and other hostile elements that have entrenched themselves in our nation. American patriotism is a patriotism in dissent against a status-quo that hates this country. We will emphasize this wherever and to whoever we can. All will know the struggles that the patriots and the cause for America have gone through and are going through now."
 USC_empower_the_agents_of_change: "Empower the Agents of Change"
 USC_empower_the_agents_of_change_desc: "There are many loyal American citizens, both outside and inside of our government, that have spent a lot of time fighting for this country and trying to make it a better place for their fellow patriots. We must recognize the efforts of these patriots and give them recognition along with hearing their concerns bettering this nation. Only by empowering these agents of change will we get one step closer to achieving our goal of making America great again."
 USC_end_wartime_censorship: "End Wartime Censorship"
 USC_end_wartime_censorship_desc: "The harsh conditions of the war had initially required us to clamp down on information outlets that had the potential to harm national unity. However, now that conditions have changed, we can with confidence repeal our wartime censorship laws and regulations. Citizens and media outlets will now have much more freedom to report on and say what they please without fear of penalty. Free speech is a right in the constitution after all, and it would be embarrassing to keep such restrictions going on forever."
 USC_land_of_the_free: "Land of the Free"
 USC_land_of_the_free_desc: "America is a nation that was from its very beginning dedicated to the pursuit of freedom. We were not founded by autocratic monarchies nor landed gentry; we were founded by men demanding freedom from an intolerable tyranny. This is a legacy that has lived on for America's more than 350-year-old history as a nation, a legacy that we aim to uphold in all its glory. We have come a long way in our struggle for the saving of this country and amidst our pain and setbacks we keep one sacred promise close to us. Just as our predecessors fought hard to keep Americans free, we too will fight hard to keep this country free."
 USC_smash_the_import_economy: "Smash the Import Economy"
 USC_smash_the_import_economy_desc: "America is a vast nation with a lot of people, space, and natural resources; an advantage that secured our country's rise to international prominence more than a century ago. However, globalization and treasonous coastal liberal elites have squandered all of this by chaining the US economy to imports from a lot of foreign nations. This will no longer be tolerated. We will institute new tariffs and regulations that will get our economy off importing things that can be readily made here. Once American firms no longer worry about being driven out of business by foreigners, they can focus on building up their businesses and returning our economy to where it should be; all-American."
 USC_bring_our_jobs_home: "Bring Our Jobs Home"
 USC_bring_our_jobs_home_desc: "A tragic casualty of globalization has been the loss of so many American jobs, many being in the manufacturing sector, to overseas competitors. Now is the time for us to rectify this economic tragedy by bringing these lost jobs back home to the US. We will reach out to major firms who employ people in areas such as manufacturing and have them reestablish or expand operations here in the US. Whether it be through financial stipends, laxer regulations, or special deals, we will get these firms to rapidly increase employment in sectors of the economy deeply affected by offshoring. The people of this nation will have their jobs again, we will make sure of that."
 USC_the_harvest_of_progress: "The Harvest of Progress"
 USC_the_harvest_of_progress_desc: "This country, for most of its history, has had most of its population working and living off agriculture. From the early days of the colonists to the end of the last century, millions of Americans worked the fields both for profit and sustainment. In our plan to reinvigorate the US economy, we will focus on the millions of Americans who work in agriculture or live in rural communities that support agriculture. The future will be built not on a narrow band of companies in a few big cities, but instead on the reinvention and rebuilding of rural America and the ways of life that support it."
 USC_bringing_back_america: "Bringing Back America"
 USC_bringing_back_america_desc: "For much of this country's history, everyone knew this nation as a place where there was plenty of everything. There was plenty of food, housing, jobs, and opportunities of all forms. This war had ruined so much of those prospects, but we will soon be bringing all of that back; we will bring America back. Through our efforts to rebuild and reinvest in our economy and the major players that are important in its development, we will bring back a lot of the economic and social sense of security that made America so special and prosperous."
 USC_powerhouse_of_production: "Powerhouse of Production"
 USC_powerhouse_of_production_desc: "In rebuilding and growing America's economy, we must turn to a major strength that this country still holds to this day; our industry. Our government will begin giving out financial assistance for new projects and collaborating with existing major industrial conglomerates to grow our civilian industrial base. New factories will be opened, more people will find work in the industrial sector of this economy, and our gross industrial output will significantly increase. America will once again become a powerhouse of industrial production that the world will envy."
 USC_economic_adrenaline_shots: "Economic Adrenaline Shots"
 USC_economic_adrenaline_shots_desc: "One of the easiest and most straightforward ways of growing our economy is by simply investing money in it. We shall look at promising and important firms doing business here in this country and give them direct financial assistance. With this money, they will cover losses, expand production, and hire more people which in turn will grow the economy. It is not an intricate strategy, but we know it will have immediately noticeable macroeconomic benefits."
 USC_no_mercy_for_traitors: "No Mercy for Traitors"
 USC_no_mercy_for_traitors_desc: "In our fight for America, we have come across the most heinous and vile groups and individuals who dare call themselves "Americans". They have betrayed this nation through their violent rampages that have killed so many of their innocent countrymen and destroyed so much of this nation. Now that many of these despicable people are in our hands, we will deliver unto them a swift and straightforward punishment: death and destruction."
 USC_rebuild_in_our_image: "Rebuild in our Image"
 USC_rebuild_in_our_image_desc: "As we rebuild this country from the devastation of war, we will also be doing it within our image of a new America. We will sweep away the failures of the pre-war government and society and build on top of it a new nation that will not repeat the same failures. So much will be changed from way at the top within our government all the way to the bottom with the things that affect the average American daily. All the failed private and public institutions, policies, projects and so much more built upon failed ideas before the war will be tossed aside for a vigorous new vision of this nation: our vision."
 USC_promote_patriotic_media: "Promote Patriotic Media"
 USC_promote_patriotic_media_desc: "It is so unfortunate that a lot of America's media outlets are in the hands of treasonous socialists and other hostile liberal elements that smear us wherever we go. However, they are not the only ones that have access to tools to broadcast political ideology. We will reach out to a variety of media outlets loyal to our cause and provide them with increased funding and heavy public promotion. Once we have a media landscape that is heavily supportive of our cause and endeavors, we can expect much more earnest support from the average population."
 USC_home_of_the_brave: "Home of the Brave"
 USC_home_of_the_brave_desc: "Unlike other nations, we were born amid great struggle and conflict; a struggle for freedom and independence. It took a lot of bravery and courage for the average American to stand up to the British Empire, and it took the same courage for America to continue on the tough road ahead. Throughout our history, we have faced down challenge after challenge and come out on top. It took bravery for Americans to fight the British in 1812, the Germans in the world wars, and to face down the communists in the Cold War. We too have only shown grit and bravery in our fight to keep our freedom and nation out of the hands of our enemies. Just as the brave founded America, the valiant Americans of today have fought hard to keep this great nation only made of the bravest."
 USC_build_the_freedom_cities: "Build the Freedom Cities"
 USC_build_the_freedom_cities_desc: "In our reconstruction of America, we will finally be able to reconstruct whole urban metropolises based on our vision for this nation. These new cities will be totally unrecognizable compared to the older and failed cities built and run by coastal liberal and socialist elites. These "freedom" cities will be made in our economic, social, and political vision for how a true American city needs to look like. They will represent the best and most beautiful of not just our values and achievements, but also America's values and achievements as well."
 USC_rural_renaissance: "Rural Renaissance"
 USC_rural_renaissance_desc: "For too long, the rural communities of this nation have been neglected and left to rot, but not anymore. Under our direction we shall not just reinvest in the rural parts of this country, rather we shall make them the showcase of our great nation. Both our state and federal governments will begin providing massive investments and rebuilding projects to make rural America great again. They will have jobs to work in, good homes to live in, safe communities, and overall be proud of where they live. They shall once again be communities where the American dream thrived and prospered."
 USC_kickstart_the_automotive_industry: "Kickstart the Automotive Industry"
 USC_kickstart_the_automotive_industry_desc: "The American automotive industry was once a multi-billion-dollar behemoth that the nations of the world struggled to rival. Unfortunately, the last couple of decades have hollowed out a once great and proud sector of this country's economy. However, we will not let this industry decline any further. Our government will immediately reach out to and collaborate with our top remaining car manufacturers to revive and expand production. We will provide grants, worker training programs, new loans for equipment, and favorable contracts to these automobile companies to expand their operations. We will soon return this country's automotive industry to where it should be; second to none."
 USC_operation_steel_forge: "Operation Steel Forge"
 USC_operation_steel_forge_desc: "Our nation's steel and iron production used to be the best in the world, an industrial capability that unfortunately fell apart in the last few decades. Even though such capabilities have declined, we will waste no time in reviving and expanding our current steel production capabilities. Our currently established steel manufacturers will receive new loans, financial investment, and promotion to expand their current operations and to increase steel production. Expanding our steel manufacturing should give us a great basis to continue our expansion of both our civilian and military industries."
 USC_beautify_the_nation: "Beautify the Nation"
 USC_beautify_the_nation_desc: "This war has done more than just destroy our ways of life, it has also destroyed a lot of the landmarks and natural landscapes that made this country so beautiful. We will immediately begin a program of national "beautification" that will include rebuilding our monuments, parks, and other important spaces that made so many parts of this nation great places to live in. We will also institute programs to remove a lot of the urban decay from major population centers that are currently bad eye sores. America will soon be a nation of both great power and beauty."
 USC_redefine_martial_law: "Redefine Martial Law"
 USC_redefine_martial_law_desc: "The current crisis that is this war has forced us to institute martial law. However, our current legal definition falls short of what we need to truly secure order. We will promptly redefine the powers and scope of martial law to give us more authority to crack down on our enemies and other treasonous elements. When our police and security forces receive these new expanded powers, the traitors and fifth columnists hiding among us will soon have nowhere to run."
 USC_refreshing_the_tree_of_liberty: "Refreshing the Tree of Liberty"
 USC_refreshing_the_tree_of_liberty_desc: "The victory of democracy cannot be achieved without spilling the blood of the tyrants that try to destroy it. This is a lesson that has been taught many times over the course of American history and it is a lesson that we will now embrace with dedication. The domestic traitors, enemies, and fifth columnists that we have apprehended will be handed down swift and terrible punishments. Certain actors will be given a lengthy sentence, but many will receive the ultimate punishment for their crimes; death. Their demise will serve as the ultimate reminder that freedom must never be trifled with."
 USC_saviour_of_the_republic: "Savior of the Republic"
 USC_saviour_of_the_republic_desc: "President Trump has worked tirelessly and fearlessly in the fight to save our republic from its enemies. While many other leading politicians cowered in fear or defected to the side of opportunism and treason, he stood up for the defense of the nation. His leadership and guidance in this fight for the salvation of our republic must stand as an important rally point for all loyal patriots of this country."
 USC_restructure_the_party_system: "Restructure the Party System"
 USC_restructure_the_party_system_desc: "The old two-party system of this nation's politics is a relic that must be swiftly disposed of. In its place will be a newly restructured party system that will do away with the elitist deep state politics of the old system. Our party will still retain its dominant position, but we will allow the formation of new political groups and organizations within our government. New parties can be formed who will not have to worry about behemoths like the Democratic Party squashing them or the system making it impossible to attain representation in Congress."
 USC_revival_of_nationwide_faith: "Revival of Nationwide Faith"
 USC_revival_of_nationwide_faith_desc: "America was a nation founded not on morally bankrupt atheism, rather it was founded on the Judeo-Christian faith and its morals. The last fifty years have seen a serious decline in religious belief and church attendance, but we will not allow this decline to go any further. We will meet with key faith leaders of this nation and organize a revival of religion in American public life. Our political program must include the emphasizing of our Chrisitan heritage and how important religious faith is for every man, woman, and child. We are one nation, under God after all."
 USC_prune_the_republican_party: "Prune the Republican Party"
 USC_prune_the_republican_party_desc: "The Republican Party has shown itself to be a party thoroughly dedicated to President Trump's leadership and the struggle to take back this nation from its enemies. However, there are many members of the party that have repeatedly caused issues and even sabotaged things either for their own personal gain or for ideological reasons. All these members that have only created problems will be dealt with immediately either through demotion or being fired from their roles within the party. We have no room for opportunists and troublemakers who stand in the way of the will of this nation and its president."
 USC_for_faith_and_flag: "For Faith and Flag"
 USC_for_faith_and_flag_desc: "Our service and achievements for the good of this nation have been for more than just political brownie points; it is much more than that. Our commitment is to the ideal of this nation, our patriotism for it, and the moral values of our faith that make it all worthwhile. The true patriots of this country devote themselves to not just being patriots of their country, but for our common Christian faith that held together the social fabric of our republic; this is what makes us Americans. For faith and flag are our guiding principles and they shall remain so until our dying breath."
 USC_revive_the_american_spirit: "Revive the American Spirit"
 USC_revive_the_american_spirit_desc: "What makes an American an American? So much of that has been lost in recent times, but we still remember the true spirit that makes our people so special. The individualist drive for success, the love of freedom, our Judeo-Chrisitan moral values, and our suspicion of government are some of the many American values that we must revive and instill within the people. Wherever we go, we will keep these values in mind and promote them wherever possible, only then will we be confident that we have preserved the spirit of this nation."
 USC_ban_the_dnc: "Ban the DNC"
 USC_ban_the_dnc_desc: "The Democratic National Committee has repeatedly proved itself to be a tool for only the most treasonous elements of this country. The liberals and their socialist friends have used the institutions of the Democratic Party to attack and sabotage us at every turn. We will tolerate this no longer. It is time that we outlawed the DNC and crack down on their sinister activities."
 USC_reconstruct_the_intelligence_apparatus: "Reconstruct the Intelligence Apparatus"
 USC_reconstruct_the_intelligence_apparatus_desc: "Our intelligence agencies have so far proved very useful in the war, but now we must reconstruct them for a new task. There are many political actors and groups that pose a threat to our president and the unity of our party, which is where our intelligence agencies will step in. We will use their skills, tools, and powers to monitor or thwart these potentially dangerous groups from trying to become too influential within our government. Just as our agencies have spied on our enemies on the battlefield, they will now do it to our enemies that are acting within the halls of our government or on our streets."
 USC_one_party_for_one_america: "One Party for One America"
 USC_one_party_for_one_america_desc: "The two-party system of old or a multi-party system that some have proposed all failed to recognize the truth of our new political environment. Our party was the only party to sacrifice and dedicate so much to the salvation of this country from its enemies, so naturally it should have the ultimate say in leading this government. Our party will be the only party here in this country that matters politically, end of story. Under our rule alone will America succeed, not under them."
 USC_crush_the_fake_news_mob: "Crush the Fake News Mob"
 USC_crush_the_fake_news_mob_desc: "The liberal and socialist media outlets of this country have only worked to spread division, strife, and the worst of fake news. Now we will end their silly operations to spread slander about our great country. Our law enforcement agencies will go in where they can and shut down these treasonous and slanderous outlets. Along with this, we will mobilize our own media outlets and supporters to mount their own public attacks against the fake news mob. We will not rest in our fight to stop fake news from polluting our great nation and its people."
 USC_the_trump_amendments: "The Trump Amendments"
 USC_the_trump_amendments_desc: "In our effort to restructure the American government, we have encountered a few major roadblocks, primarily being certain laws and regulations. President Trump has already gone forward and written up a variety of new constitutional amendments that will finally give us the powers we need to properly lead this country into the great future we have planned for it. These amendments range from lifting the two-term limit to removing restrictions on the executive branch. Our grand plan to make America great again will no longer be hampered by old laws and regulations."
 USC_protector_of_american_life: "Protector of American Life"
 USC_protector_of_american_life_desc: "Our enemies have worked without end to not just defeat us on the battlefield, but to exterminate the American way of life itself. President Trump and his party have done so much to defend the common American's way of life in the face of such hideous opposition. His leadership and guidance in the fight to save the life, liberty, and happiness of all Americans must stand as an important rally point for all loyal patriots of this country."
 USC_remove_anti_american_leadership: "Remove Anti-American Leadership"
 USC_remove_anti_american_leadership_desc: "Within our government we have had the disgrace of encountering many politicians that have cast doubt and division on our great struggle for the salvation of this nation. Their suspicious conduct and even outright anti-American activities leave us with one choice; their immediate removal. We will be immediately firing and removing these politicians that have failed not just us, but this whole country as well."
 USC_ensure_court_loyalty: "Ensure Court Loyalty"
 USC_ensure_court_loyalty_desc: "The Supreme Court of this country is a critical institution in evaluating the constitutionality of laws passed by our government. It is now highly important that we secure their loyalty to our party and president. Through appointments, dismissals, and even some legal and political machinations behind the scenes, the justices of the Supreme Court will be brought to our side. Our effort to make America great again must not just have the party or presidency going along rather it must have all branches of the government going along."
 USC_find_order_in_chaos: "Find Order in Chaos"
 USC_find_order_in_chaos_desc: "In these turbulent times of anarchy, terror, and chaos, we must stand as a force of order and peace when others have failed to ensure it. President Trump and his colleagues have proven to be one of the only forces within this country to have successfully brought back order to a nation within the jaws of chaos. Our government must do its utmost to show to the people that peace and tranquility are our primary objectives. As we succeed both on the battlefield and the home front, we can feel confident that more and more people will have faith in our president and government's mission."
 USC_patriotic_education: "Patriotic Education"
 USC_patriotic_education_desc: "To ensure that patriotism and loyalty to this nation do not end with this current generation, we must make it a certainty that the youth of this country are taught these ideals. We will institute new changes in the curriculum of our public schools to reflect the importance of learning about patriotism. From pre-K to the end of high school, students will need to take classes on the values of our country, what it means to be a patriot, and the dangers of ideologies like socialism. Our younger generation will no longer be in the disgusting hands of our enemy's propaganda and anti-Americanism but instead will become the most devout of patriots that we can feel confident in leaving the future to."
 USC_the_cross_wrapped_in_the_flag: "The Cross Wrapped in the Flag"
 USC_the_cross_wrapped_in_the_flag_desc: "To be a leader in this country takes values, values that guide a leader to make good decisions for the nation and people. America is a republic founded on Judeo-Christian moral values which helped form not just our society, but our politics as well. We will work to instill in our great offices of government the principles of our faith so that their faith will represent the faith of the people of this great republic."
 USC_crush_the_globalist_tyrants: "Crush the Globalist Tyrants"
 USC_crush_the_globalist_tyrants_desc: "The elitist liberal bureaucrats and their globalist friends in NGOs and other sinister organizations have been working day and night to undermine the American nation. Now that we are in control it is time to reign in their schemes. The organizations active in the US that parrot such nonsense will be swiftly criminalized and dismantled. If they are Americans, they will be removed from their cozy posts in those organizations and if they are foreigners they will be deported. America values its identity and independence; these internationalist morons can leave!"
 USC_defenders_of_american_values: "Defenders of American Values"
 USC_defenders_of_american_values_desc: "This battle to save this country is not just a battle fought with rifles and tanks, but values too. We are fighting an enemy that wishes to destroy the values of this country and replace it with values totally foreign to all of us. The loyal patriots of this country, especially under the guidance of President Trump, have fought hard to uphold true American values in the face of constant assault by America's domestic and foreign enemies. We will march to the end to upkeep the values that have made America what it is for as long as we live."
 USC_where_we_go_all: "Where We Go All!"
 USC_where_we_go_all_desc: "President Trump and his party have achieved much in the defense of this country and the ascendancy of true patriotism to the halls of power. His leadership, his courage, his determination, and his charisma have marked him as a politician of the ages. All of America finds great inspiration in his presidency. Where he goes, we all go!"
 USC_through_the_barrel_of_a_gun: "Through the Barrel of a Gun"
 USC_through_the_barrel_of_a_gun_desc: "Not all politics is debate and speeches. Sometimes if you want to strive to get something, you have to use the universally understood symbol of power over others; force. This war is just a massive scaled up version of this principle. We have fought through so much to get where we are, and we will certainly not let up in our never-ending duty to keep this country safe from its enemies. President Trump understood this quite early on as he was not afraid to call upon his fellow patriots to engage in the ultimate struggle for this country. He even once said, "you can't take back your country with weakness!"."

 USC_rural_economy_idea_desc: "The states of the Great Plains are not known for their industrial prowess. From the great Mississippi to the Rocky Mountains, vast farms stretch across the plains, containing numerous rural towns and communities with few industrial zones in between. As a result, our economy is dominated by the agricultural sector. Our nation's limited industrial capabilities have restricted the ability to develop our industrials and hinders our ability to wage long-term industrial warfare against hostile powers."

However, that's where the agreements seem to end. Within the chain of command, factionalism has run rampant with Generals and officers at each others throats over the role of the military and how it fights this war.

From established militia groups formed in recent years, to volunteer forces raised after the lines were drawn, many have their own opinions as to the nature of the war being fought, and what they wish to come from the struggle.

Though the split of the Deepstate from our administration will ensure the America First agenda will advance unopposed, the short-term consequence has been not only a complete political whiplash but a complete collapse of our intelligence sector with the bulk of the intelligence community siding with Deepstate.

 usc.1.desc: "An all familiar flag is raised above a scarred nation.\n\nMany had wished to see America in ruins forever, an angry mob stomping on the face of freedom forever, and with our nation in great danger and our families in the crosshairs of the enemy, we had no choice but to take the fight to them. America is a beautiful country, and Americans are perhaps one of the greatest people on this earth, we survive and we thrive in times of crisis.\nThis war has taken a lot from us, too many parents that have to bury their children.\n\nWe pulled America out of the depths, ensuring neither the deep state or the terrorists would ever touch our homes again. America is back, but this time it is changed forever, a scar that will never go away.\n\nBut with our enemies gone, and our neighbors being able to love another again, we will be able to rebuild, ruined cities will be restored to their glory, veterans will be honored, past mistakes will be corrected.\n\nAmerica was great.\nAnd it will be great again."
 usc.1.a: "What separates the winners from the losers is how a person reacts to each new twist of fate"
 usc.2.t: "The Denver Crackdown"
 usc.2.desc: "The war has came to the notoriously liberal city of Denver this week as local authorities are converging completely on all leftist dissent from the locals. \"The gloves are off\" one war correspondent from the BBC claimed \"Without respect to the right to assembly, peaceful protests today were broken up by batons and live gunfire, we saw several demonstrators being shot down in the street, and sporadic gunfire can be heard through out the entire city. Helicopters have been circling the all day, the sound of their engines feels omnipresent as the constant dozens of police sirens zipping around the city. Multiple blooms of smoke can be seen right now in the distance rising from fires lit across the city. To say people are scared would be an understatement, in fact we have many counts today of leftist militant groups fighting back against the authorities although to no avail.\" Violence was especially flaring up of course around the capitol building of Denver, graphic images of dozens of bodies scattered lifelessly across the granite stairs in front of the building spreading across social media, many gunshots from various gunmen returning fire against the police pepper the building too, though there are no reports of dead police yet. This unprecedented violence on behalf of the authorities comes in the wake of Trump moving his provisional base of operations out of DC and into the city due to its central position within the country. Around 5 days ago the mayor of the city Michael Hancock was placed under house arrest, and its not yet known who will be appointed to fill in for his position, and obviously the governor of Colorado Jared Polis has been missing the last 2 weeks as well. In the words of Associated Press war correspondent \"The future of the city and of the state remains unknown, but one thing certainly is certain, it is going to get far worse before it gets better.\""
 usc.2.a: "They will never forget this."
 usc.3.t: "Trump announces Denver as new \"Legislative Hall\""
 usc.3.desc: "After Trump's hasty departure from DC word from him has been both scarce and unverified, but for the first time in days the first official claims from him have gotten out to the public. The status of the new base of operations for Trumps side has been up in the air for a little while now, but the questions around where it might be has finally been answered as it will be in Denver, Colorado. However Trump has heavily specified that this should not be considered a capitol, but rather a \"Provisional Legislative Hall\" as to not de-legitimize him as the rightful leader of the United States. Almost immediately after this news came out, the Governor of Colorado Jared Polis and his family have gone missing mysteriously. This news has sparked mass outrage in the heavily leftist city with chants of \"It's our city, not Trump's city!\" being heard across the streets, and of course mass burnings and lootings of businesses. The Denver police are certainly being pushed to their limit with this news as the riots are proving to be more infernal than the ones experienced last summer. At this rate Trump may be forced to take drastic measures to ensure the security of the city."
 usc.3.a: "Fiery, but mostly peaceful, for now."
 usc.4.t: "The Future Of The Government"
 usc.4.desc: "With Denver fully secured by the Trump Administration and the remnants of Congress now comfortably seated, one of the first issues to arise is the status of Habeas Corpus.\n\nSuspended by Abraham Lincoln during the first American Civil War, the military has advocated the suspension of Hapeas Corpus in order to effectively drive back the rebel forces besieging the nation and restore the union.\n\nCongress, on the otherhand, has expressed it's concern over the potential of suspending Habeas Corpus, fearing the act would lead to an erosion of the people's government and allow authoritarian ideals to seep into the government.\n\nWith the war still in its early days and the outcome of the conflict not yet decided, this decision may define Trump's legacy. Shall we go the way of Lincoln and suspend Hapeas Corpus or shall the People's government,despite the current crisis, still endure?"

 usc.10.t: "The Union Befelled"
 usc.10.desc: "After months of relentless conflict and the sacrifice of countless patriots, we have achieved a resounding victory: the Union of America and its corrupt institutions have been decisively defeated. With the capture of Union-held Washington DC and other key cities that resisted our advance, the Union's government has disintegrated, leaving the majority of their territory under our control. Despite this significant achievement, pockets of militias and remnants of the Union military continue to resist. Some are still unaware of their government's surrender, while others, fueled by bitterness and defiance, refuse to accept their defeat. It is imperative that we confront and neutralize these factions. Ignoring them could jeopardize not only our ongoing military operations but also our reconstruction efforts as we work toward reuniting America.\n\nWith our primary adversary subdued, our attention must now turn to the monumental task of reuniting and governing the fractured nation. Although the militias, fascists, and communists that hold sway in the remaining territories may appear weaker than our forces, we must not underestimate them. Like a cornered fox, they are dangerous and resourceful, preparing themselves for a protracted struggle.

Trump, the often spat-on populist ridiculed by every snobbish academic and establishment politician, had defied the all-so mighty liberal establishment and lived to see the day. However, those days are gone and gave way to today's very harsh reality: playing politics in pre-war America was one thing, but running a government with deep factionalism during a state of war was another...\nAs on any other day during the work week, Trump could be found in his office, with a cup of his favorite coffee, fiddling through a mound of paperwork submitted for the day. As the government's president, he was the final say on a variety of issues and the target of a variety of groups wanting in on some big favors. The American Constitutional Government's Armed Forces, although to the public the most devout of loyal patriots, had quite the list of \"interests\" that they wanted dealt with favorably. Lists or requisitions requests, invoices for lots of funds, and requests for issues to be resolved in their favor; the demands were mind-numbingly extensive. Congress, always wanting to preserve their say in everything, had their own interests as well, often demanding president Trump to act on the often decried \"unconstitutional overreach\" of some key players in the military. Other than the pressing issues of defeating the Biden government in Washington, Congress would often be busy debating and bickering what the military did today that broke some Congressional protocol or statue to Trump's annoyance.\nAmongst the mess of politics within the American Constitutional Government, one question remained: What was the Commander in Chief to do?\nTrump picked up the first packet of invoices for the day, read the title and header, and sighed to himself as he only had one thought:"

For years, he had been a dedicated bureaucrat, working as a document processor in the Colorado Springs area, which had been crucial to the Constitutionalist government he was serving under. He had been in this job well before the Civil War, and didn't necessarily support any of the candidates, only working to put food on the table. Every day was the same; he logged onto his computer, doing needless administrative work, manual data entry and routing documents through various channels, before filing the paperwork on his desk and clocking out. He slumped over in his chair, listening to the sound of his computer fan as he filed through the forms and reports on his desk.\nBut today was different. Today, McCarthy found himself facing the unthinkable: termination. The letter of dismissal lay on his desk, as he stared in disbelief. All the work and effort he thought he had put in, reduced to nothing with the stroke of a pen. He glanced over the document, noting that it had been addressed to Mathias Yang, the Chief Administrative Officer. With a heavy heart, McCarthy rose from his chair and made his way down the familiar corridors, each step being marked with uncertainty. As he reached the office of his superior, McCarthy's palms grew clammy, and his pulse quickened.\nEntering the office, Sean found Mr. Yang seated behind his imposing desk, his stern expression betraying no hint of emotion. \"Sean,\" he began, \"I'm afraid we have to let you go.\" The words hit Sean like a truck, as he remained silent, clenching the letter of dismissal. Mr. Yang sighed heavily, continuing to speak. \"It was a very hard decision, Sean. The bureaucracy across our country has slowly slipped into inefficiency, corruption, and has become wrapped in red tape.\" he replied, clearly reading from some sort of script. \"While you were a great worker, the manual paperwork you've been doing has no purpose anymore. Simply put, we cannot afford to carry the dead weight, and we are.. trimming the administrative fat and cutting the red tape, so to speak. Please turn in your letter of dismissal and gather your belongings.\"\nSean did as such, shuffling out of the office, never to return."

 usc.17.desc: "Today, President Trump has decided to confide in his top advisors regarding the proposition of five new Amendments to the Constitution, collectively referred to as the \"Trump Amendments\". The first, which if ratified would become the 28th Amendment, proposes the establishment of a nationwide gubernatorial term limit of two terms, with only 36 states in the Union having such a limit. This Amendment also repeals the 22nd Amendment, allowing for an unlimited amount of Presidential terms. This is likely to be extremely controversial when brought to Congress, though the Amendment is likely to be ratified by both Houses. The next Amendment would constitutionally outlaw lobbying, overruling Citizens' United v. FEC. This is bound to be challenged by both State conventions and Congress, though it is likely to be accepted if those loyal to our President pull through nationwide. Donald Trump and the Republican Party have advocated for a Balanced Budget Amendment for years, and now they have finally decided it is time to act on it. Such an Amendment would require that a state cannot spend more than its income. This is, of course, very likely to be ratified.\n\nAnd for the last two, which are arguably the most important, Donald Trump has proposed an Amendment outright abolishing government bureaucracy. For years, overextended and overreaching bureaucrats were dismissed by our government, with it greatly increasing administrative efficiency. While this has had negative effects, it is clear that reducing the bureaucracy is not enough, and we must abolish it. Trump proposes that the abolition of bureaucracy through an Amendment would streamline decision-making, increase flexibility, enhance innovation, and reduce administrative costs. Finally, the last Amendment proposed by Donald Trump would give the military, as well as instated federal militias, the responsibility of \"re-establishing a government loyal to the American people\" in the case of the Constitution being betrayed. In other words, the direct overthrow of the American government if the Constitution is violated. This has been left vague in its writing and is bound to be the most controversial Amendment proposed by far. Such an overthrow would be non-violent unless necessary otherwise, with this Amendment acting as the ultimate vanguard of the Constitution."

Ever since the start of the Civil War, MSNBC had been in overdrive to cover the \"many sides and stories\" of the war. Or, at least that is what they preached. In reality, MSNBC had been relegated to a puppet of the Unionists, constantly attacking President Trump at every possible corner and serving as one of the strongest media wings of the \"Union\" of America. As he shuffled out of his cubicle, he couldn't help but notice the wailing of sirens outside, and so did his coworkers.

Of course, ever since the Constitutionalist takeover, MSNBC had been under scrutiny, though a violent break-in?

Every instance they give in time and resources to this silly infighting, the communists, the anarchists, the criminals, and the traitors in Washington come closer and closer; this notion almost drove him crazy. True patriots of a nation do not give into such petty attempts to outdo each other but instead do what needs to be done to win the war; to make America great again.

Trump, of course.\n\nFrom the very start, he has promoted an America where the values of freedom, individualism, self-reliance, and conservatism are victorious over those who seek to take them away. Drawing inspiration from the Founding Fathers' vision of a nation built on the principles of limited government is the only way to emerge victorious over the Democrats and build a new America, and Trump knows this. He has outlined his plans to cut bureaucratic red tape, slash taxes, and unleash the full potential of the American economy. The revitalization of American industry, an end to insurrection, and the establishment of law guided by the Will of the People. Every American is a revolutionary, and this should be reflected in our policies and the Armed Forces. The noble and righteous cause is being threatened, and we must not let it falter. As Washington triumphed at Yorktown, on his own soil, so too will we emerge victorious through blood alone. There have already been several Minutemen brigades trained, who will act as the backbone for militias fighting on the front, being highly mobile, loyal, and specially trained for surgical operations. These men will surely promote and spread our cause, and we must continue to push these ideas and promote revolutionary nostalgia if Trump's vision is to be fulfilled and he claims his rightful place as a Refounding Father."

 usc.33.desc: "As Donald Trump's MRAP wound its way through the streets of New York City, the once vibrant metropolis lay in ruins, ashes scattered in every street and the leveled remains of buildings as far as the eye can see. The skyline, once characterized by towering skyscrapers, was now obscured by a thick shroud of smoke and dust. Trump Tower, his most prized asset, stood battered and broken, a once beautiful condominium that overlooked midtown Manhattan now marred by gaping holes and charred remnants. The sight struck Trump to his core, as he couldn't help but remember when he had overlooked its construction and the Grand Opening all the way back in the 80s. It was a reminder of the devastation wrought by the war that had engulfed the nation. His heart heavy with sorrow and regret, he gazed upon the wreckage of his birth city, feeling a profound sense of loss for what had shaped his career and pushed him into the political landscape.\n\nAfter a few gestures to his driver, he stepped out of his vehicle and watched the scene before him. Trump's emotions began to overwhelm him, as he realized that his beloved city, his empire, had been reduced to rubble. For a fleeting moment, he considered the possibility of salvaging what remained of the Tower, of rebuilding what had been lost, reclaiming the old conglomerate that guided him through his life. But then, with a heavy heart, Trump made his decision. He turned his back on the ruins, leaving behind what remained of his former life. In that moment, he realized that there were greater battles to be fought. His country needed him, and he was the only man capable of protecting it. He walked away from the devastation, back to his entourage as his thoughts turned to the nation he had sworn to defend, to the people who looked to him for guidance. Victory, he knew, was within his grasp, and he must stop at nothing to achieve it. He shuffled back into the vehicle, setting his sights to the future as it drove off."

After years of turmoil, strife, and bloodshed, he finally returned to the seat of power he had fought so hard to reclaim. Yet, the weight of the Civil War still hung heavy on his shoulders, and so too did it show in Washington D.C. The White House was mostly unharmed, though it was unkempt, and certain parts were very clearly charred. As he stepped out of his vehicle and gazed up at the building from which he had sat only years ago, Trump couldn't help but marvel at the resilience of the American spirit. Despite the devastation and destruction brought on by the war, the White House stood tall and proud in defiance of the chaos it had suffered through. It had only been a week after the liberation of the city from the Democrats, removing them from the seat of power and winning their largest symbolic victory yet. Luckily, the city had long been cleared, and Trump was here to stay this time.But as he left his vehicle and entered the building, he was overcome by a profound sense of melancholy. The memories of the war, of the conflicts fought and the lives lost, the patriots who were gunned down in the midst of battle, flooded his mind. Yet, amidst the suffering, he also felt a glimmer of hope. Hope for a future for all Americans, one that would act as a shining beacon enduring under his leadership, one that would never fall to division ever again. As he made his way through the white corridors, surrounded by portraits of the Founding Fathers, Trump vowed to honor the sacrifices of those who had come before him and to never forget the price of freedom. And as he settled into the Oval Office, surrounded by his advisors, he glanced around, sitting in the Presidential chair. Of course, the road ahead would not be easy, nothing in Trump's life had been easy. It was all shaped by hard work, dedication, and his iron will; one that had stood the test of time."

With his appointment, Trump has effectively entrenched the values core to his ideology into American governance for the foreseeable future.\n\nIn a statement earlier today, Rubio stated that America will continue to prioritize the interests of its citizens above all else, as well as continuing to unite the Grand Old Party against both internal and external adversaries through the means of populist traditionalism, preached by Trump himself ever since his first inauguration, making it clear that this brand of conservatism will remain at the forefront of the government and the Republican Party. Trump has congratulated his new Right-Hand Man, and has publicly stated that he is \"the best man for the job\", and the only one who can \"defend American values and tradition as I do\".

Despite having been fired from his position as an advisor within the first 20 days of the Trump Administration back in 2016, he left retirement to lead the Constitutional government's military, acting as the figurehead for the Army's political wing, and has embodied recent shifts in the GOP towards authoritarianism. With his appointment, he has effectively entrenched the values core to his ideology into American governance for the foreseeable future and strengthened the position of the Armed Forces.\nIn a statement earlier today, Flynn stated that America will continue to prioritize the interests of national defense above all else, as well as continuing efforts to maintain Law and Order, which has practically become his campaign slogan to the dismay of many of his colleagues. This has bewildered many in the country due to Flynn's status in the Army, though this is not entirely unprecedented.

A meeting was called with the Constitutionalist high command to discuss the situation.\n\"Mr. President, you wanted us,\" said Flynn.\n\"Yes, Flynn, I did. Apparently, the liberal army is routing our forces on the frontlin-,\" said Trump before he was interrupted by John Raymond.\n\"Sir, if I may, we can easily compensate for this. It wouldn't be hard to get off the back foot currently,\" said Raymond.\n\"I know that Raymond. Don't worry. All I'm asking for is that we get our routing forces reorganized. We all knew we wouldn't have an easy fight here. After all, hard times make heroes.\"\nDuring the meeting, Trump and his field marshals discussed strategies, sabotage, delayment, and everything else to start turning the tide on the frontline. Overall, it was a relatively calm meeting. All of Constitutionalist high command had been warned beforehand that they would most likely experience losses on the first days of war and that they should focus on recovery instead of counterattacks.\nBy the end of the meeting, Trump's field marshals felt relatively accomplished by what they had discussed.

As he walked into the room he saw a map of the war in America, on it was the dark blue of the ACG and the light blue of the UoA. It made him mad, he was annoyed that his forces weren't doing enough to hold the frontline, and he was mad at his generals for not doing enough to compensate for the situation. However, as he sat down and started the meeting, he decided to hide his anger to maintain the image he had built.\n\"Flynn the situation on the frontline isn't good, to say the least, I've expected more from you. But it is fine, you can still prove yourself.\" Said Trump with a disciplinarian tone.\n\"Thank you, Mr. President.\" Said Flynn nodding his head.\n\"Now gentlemen, as we know the situation on the frontline isn't the most comfortable, to say the least. However, I'm still confident we can turn the tide in this war.\"\n\"What is your strategy then Mr. President?\" Said John Kelly\n\"Well Kelly, my plan is that we reinforce our lines and start planning counter-attacks, we can't allow any more major retreats and we have to take back some territory. While our forces are massing on the frontline we ramp up the smuggling of guns, ammo, and logistics to the brave resistance currently fighting to liberate our occupied lands.\" Said Trump.\nAs the meeting progressed Trump and his field marshals informed the generals on how the counterattacks, as well as the strengthening of resistance, would be carried out. Overall the meeting lasted way longer than usual, as the problems would always come up before a plan could be agreed upon.\nHowever in the end the attendees of the meeting finally agreed to instead focus more efforts on the resistance operations, as they would wait until the resistance had damaged UoA logistics and organization enough so that the counterattack would be assured an effective outcome."

For Cooper Carmenates, anti-aircraft fire lit up the air instead. As he looked out of his window on the southwest side of the Pentagon, he gazed upon the city of Arlington, remembering his commander's orders to retreat towards the Pentagon instead of surrendering. Such a fool he was to follow that command. Now, because of his naivety, he was holed up with around two hundred other soldiers inside the military command building. \n\nAs he continued to look out the window he thought to himself, about his childhood, his teen years, and eventually life as an adult before it was rudely cut off because of the civil war. How he was planning to marry his high school sweetheart before he joined the army, how he was sent to the front, watching his comrades die around him as he was the only one standing. Whether it be the forests of Illinois, the suburbs of Indianapolis, and finally, the once bustling streets of Arlington. Taking a drag from his cigarette, he pondered his fate, regretting the decisions that brought to him here, The Pentagon, where it housed him and two hundred others, awaiting the inevitable.\n\nSuddenly he heard a faint noise in the distance, not the anti-aircraft fire, no he would know if it was that. Either it was just another convoy of Constitutional troops that would try and take the Pentagon for the fifth time today, or another batch of civilian buses leaving DC to avoid annihilation. Either way, he grabbed his rifle, radioed to his squad that they could be attacked soon, and grabbed his binoculars. But instead, he saw a lone Abrahms in the distance, one with an American flag flying on top of it, and what appeared to be a hang loose sign on its front plate. The Abrahms made their way under the Henry G. Shirley highway and stopped right outside of the Pentagon parking lot. As Cooper looked on with no reaction, the Abrahms lifted its cannon, seemingly aiming straight for his window.

But they can enjoy their fake little victory for now, they're not winning the real fight. America wants the real republican president back - ME.\n\nYou know what their plans are anyway? Crazy Nikki and her military-industrial lobbyists are gonna start World War 3! They want to start wars all over the world, they want to put American lives in danger, can't think of anything else, In fact, she was so glad when the killing started in our country! Smiling from ear to ear because her donors would get richer from all the weapon sales and murder!\n\nI'm not allowed to say this because she's a woman, but if I was, I would say she's nasty and very disgusting.. Haley-Cheney, that's a rhyme you should be thinking of. Her and the other neocons, I will destroy them before they destroy our beautiful country and the rest of the planet."\n\nThe crowd cheered, laughed and roared in unison - a usual, expected reaction to the banter of their beloved idol. Opposition verbally shamed again. The base is energized once more, cheering for constitutionalist forces who bravely continue to fight on the front lines for Trump's vision of America."

Did you see the news recently? The swamp got itself a new "president", I guess Sleepy Joe wasn't doing it. Now it's Klob-... Klobu-char or whatever. Well, what can I even say about Zany Amy? There hasn't been a worse candidate in the history of our country. Like, seriously! Didn't you have anyone else? She wouldn't be my first choice, that I can tell you.\n\nDid you see her "victory speech" though? Total disaster! Zany Amy doesn't even know what to say or what she is saying. Probably didn't believe she got elected, frankly, I don't believe it either, must have been a fraud just like everything else in democrat-occupied fake America. She's a snowwoman, okay? And she's melting away, just like insurrectionist troops are melting away at the frontline. They don't have much time left and they can feel it.\n\nBut don't worry, Amy. I've already prepared a nice house for you in Minnesota, a bigger house, it's the only thing you can plan on winning right after this fake little "election". You'll be on a nice vacation for the rest of your life, I promise. I hope you're okay with that. Are you okay, Amy? Would you tell us that? I guess we'll find out soon."\n\nThe crowd cheered, laughed and roared in unison - a usual, expected reaction to the banter of their beloved idol. Opposition verbally shamed again. The base is energized once more, cheering for constitutionalist forces who bravely continue to fight on the front lines for Trump's vision of America."

I have eliminated ISIS, people that hated gays the most. In fact, Pete should ask who his husband voted for, he'd be very surprised."
