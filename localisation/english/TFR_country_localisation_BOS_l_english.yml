 BOS_collapsing_condominium: "Collapsing Condominium"
 BOS_collapsing_condominium_desc: "The dream of a united Bosniak-Serb federation following the end of Yugoslavia was envisioned as one of prosperity, egalitarianism and a shining light in the backwater of Europe that is the Balkans. Unfortunately, reality can be a cruel mistress. Bosnia-Herzegovina's inception was created as a federation of two nations in mind - Bosnia and the Republika Srpska, each representing the two of the biggest minorities in the republic, alongside a president representing every significant minority of the nation. As the constitution was ratified, old rivalries between the Serbs and Bosniaks didn't fade away as Srpska quickly began self-serving its dominant population of Serbs, often introducing their own laws and working outside of the guidance of Sarajevo, refusing to cooperate with Bosnia. Combined with an economy that hasn't truly recovered from the civil war, the Federation is on a verge of collapse with many politicians in Republika Srpska threatening to secede and ethnic violence starting to rear its ugly head."
 BOS_fallout_of_the_bosnian_spring: "Fallout of the Bosnian Spring"
 BOS_fallout_of_the_bosnian_spring_desc: "The economy is burning asunder, and it all began in Tuzla in 2014 when factory workers organized a protest against the continually unresolved unemployment and stagnant economy. This protest quickly ballooned out of control as it rose to an entire national strike against the entire government, even meeting some support in Srpska itself. Even half a decade later, the effects of the Bosnian Spring are still seen as violence on the streets in riots and protests are all too common and the government's decentralized structure prevents it from enacting any necessary measures."
 BOS_feeble_government: "Feeble Government"
 BOS_feeble_government_desc: "The structure of the Bosnia-Herzegovina government in theory allowed every minority to be represented by their own president. In practice however, the position with the most power in government ended up being none other than the High Representative, which has the power to remove elected officials from their seats. Besides being a hurdle towards Bosnia being considered a true democracy, this inadvertently contributed to Bosnia's recent spiral into instability due to a lack of action on developing the economy and ethnic bias being exhibited in favour of the High Representative's ethnic background."
