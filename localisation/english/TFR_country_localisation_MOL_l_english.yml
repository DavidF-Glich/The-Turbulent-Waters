moldova.1.t: "The Moldovan Presidential Elections Of 2020"
moldova.1.d: "The Moldovan presidential elections of 2020 are one of the most critical our nation has had in recent years with the COVID pandemic having a big impact in our already struggling country. Moldovans will have two options either east or west with current president Igor Dodon of the Party of Socialists of The Republic of Moldova (PSRM) representing the pro-Russian movement in Moldova and finally Maia Sandu of the ACUM coalition between the Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) and the Dignity and Truth Platform Party (PPDA) representing the pro-west movement in Moldova. The stakes are high and whoever wins will take the country in a radically different direction"
moldova.1.a: "Maia Sandu is elected"
