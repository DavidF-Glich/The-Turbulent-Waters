 egypt.2.a: "War is Imminent"
 egypt.3.t: "Egypt Calls Up Reserves"
 egypt.3.d: "Following months of tensions between Egypt and Ethiopia over the construction of the Resistance Dam in Guba, it seems that Egypt is preparing for the worst option. In the months preceeding the mobilization, the construction of the Resistance Dam has caused widespread water shortages in Egypt, resulting in instability that has forced the Egyptian hand. After the breakdown of the Second Dam Conference, Ethiopia responded by signing the Lake Victoria Compact, a mutual defense alliance between it and the East African Federation. Just today, Egypt has called upon tens of thousands of reservists into it's active military force as over a hundred thousand Egyptian troops have been moved towards the border.\n\nIn addition to this massive miltiary mobilization, Egypt has also created it's own military alliance with those who have suffered due to the construction of the Dam, as well as it's longtime allies in the area. As the two titans of Africa face off in the desert, it seems that the smallest spark can set the desert sands alight."
