 #Ideas
 CHI_american_protection_idea: "American Protection"
 CHI_american_protection_idea_desc: "Relying solely on the military strength of the ROC armed forces, it is clear that we cannot resist the CCP on our own. The maintenance of peace is entirely dependent on U.S. policy, which dictates that the status quo must not be altered.\n\nThe Seventh Fleet acts as a stabilizing force, akin to a pillar of certainty, upholding the fragile peace across the Taiwan Strait. Yet, this strong shield carries another implication: once the support is lost, the enemy will inevitably strike."
 CHI_taiwanese_independence_movement_idea: "Taiwanese Independence Movement"
 CHI_taiwanese_independence_movement_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_CHI_taiwanese_independence_movement_banner\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Republic of China, also known as Taiwan, has in recent years been referred to as the \"Republic of China (Taiwan).\" This naming reflects the ideological confusion within the region. Indeed, we are not even recognized as a country in the international community, which has fueled the rise of the Taiwan independence movement.\n\nSince its withdrawal from the United Nations, the Republic of China's international standing has plummeted. This decline spurred the emergence of local consciousness, which later took center stage during the democratization movement and ultimately gained political power.\n\nDespite this, the majority of the society still supports maintaining the status quo, making the path to official renaming a distant one."

 CHI_lower_mainland_influence_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_CHI_terrible_mainland_influence_banner\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last century, we once stood tall on the land of China, until the outbreak of civil war. A series of setbacks from various factors forced us to retreat to Taiwan, resulting in the loss of control over the mainland.\n\nAs time has passed, the Republic of China has generally become a historical term in the minds of mainland Chinese. Those who are aware of its existence often hold extremely negative views, while our supporters are dismissed as laughable ideologues on the internet."

 CHI_low_international_recognition_idea: "Low International Recognition"
 CHI_low_international_recognition_idea_desc: "On the global stage, the Taiwan Strait stands as a chasm of irreconcilable opposition, like water and fire, never to coexist. We are perpetually cast as the excluded party, rendering participation in international organizations a distant and unattainable aspiration—one that others take for granted.\n\nYet, as nature shows, life always seeks a path. Be it through the guise of regional titles or the efforts of civic groups, our nation persists in finding indirect channels for multilateral diplomacy, though these avenues remain profoundly constrained."

 taiwan.4.d: "Voters hed to the polls today to practice their  rights in the last bastion of liberal democracy in China. Following weeks of heavy campaigning, with both the DPP and KMT canidates accusing each other of spreading fake news and utilizing internet trolls to slander and attack the other, the fate of the nation hands on a tightrope. While the DPP argues for a greater seperation from China, the KMT asserts for a populist economic policy that involves more trade with the mainland, combined with political strategies to reassert Taiwan as the 'one true China'. In the end, the voters have given the mandate to..."

 taiwan.5.t: "Tsai Ing-Wen Secures Reelection"
 taiwan.5.d: "Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen thanked the island's electorate Saturday for putting \"democratic values into practice\" after securing more than 57% of the vote. Tsai's comfortable victory caps a remarkable comeback after devastating local election results in 2018 saw her step down as leader of the DPP following its crushing defeat in races across the self-governing island.\n\nFollowing Saturday's vote, Tsai addressed tensions with China over the territory's sovereignty, saying Taiwan is willing to engage with China but that China must respect the voice of Taiwan's voters."
 taiwan.5.a: "A Step Away From Reunification"
 taiwan.6.t: "The KMT Secure the Presidency in an Upset"
 taiwan.6.d: "President Elect Han Kuo-yu thanked the island's electorate for their electoral mandate after a suprising upset against the incumbent DPP Canidate, Tsai Ing-Wen. Banking on the older, Han emigree voters, the KMT secured a tight victory by appealing to closer relations with China following various embargos and economic troubles. By branding Tsai Ing-Wen as  out-of-touch elitist, and himself as a populist leader, he brought over many swing voters with his promises of national security following the failure of the DPP to properly assert its interests over the PRC."
