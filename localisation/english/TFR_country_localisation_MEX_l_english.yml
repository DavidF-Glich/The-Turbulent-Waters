 mexico.1.a: "Excellent"
 mexico.2.t: "Raid on Cartel Results in Failure"
 mexico.2.d: ""
 mexico.2.a: "Their Sacrafice is Noted"
 mexico.3.t: "Migrant Caravan Reaches Mexicxan-Guatemalan Border"
 mexico.3.d: "A new caravan of Hondurenos, El Salvadorians, and Guatemalans have reached our border totaling several hundred. Police have dealt with many caravans of it's size before and are ready to stop the caravan once again. Our populace has content for these caravans. No doubt many will exploit these people for gain."
 mexico.3.a: "Deploy the Police"
 mexico.3.b: "Let them pass."
 mexico.4.t: "Officers Engage Cartels"
 mexico.4.d: "Officers out on routine patrol engaged in a heavy firefight against local cartels armed with automatic rifles and machine guns. The firefight was brief, officers managed to kill the 6 gunmen who positioned themselves behind bushes and trees. Officer casualties were also low, only 2 officers recieved minor injuries and would recover rapidly."
 mexico.4.a: "Close Call."
 mexico.5.t: "Police Detain American Refugees"
 mexico.5.d: "Federal Police have been deployed in mass numbers across our border with the United States. Thousands of American refugees have been detained as they flee from the choas embroiling the entire nation. Officials estimate there are thousands more crossing into our borders each night. There is no doubt that former coyotes smuggling our people into America are doing the same for these refugees and will continue until the conflict is resolved. We suspect cartels are also active in the region, exploiting poor families and trafficing them into their business. The army is soon to be deployed in larger numbers to assist the overwhelmed officers."
 mexico.5.a: "We do what we can."
 mexico.12.t: "Mexico Reunified"
 mexico.12.desc: "The long and bloody struggle for Mexico has finally come to an end. After years of brutal warfare against cartels, corrupt regimes, and rival factions, we stand victorious. Our people, battered and weary, can now begin to rebuild. The streets, once ruled by fear and violence, are now silent, and the sound of gunfire has been replaced by the murmur of hope.\n\nThe cartels, whose influence stretched like a shadow over our land, have been shattered. Their leaders either lie dead or are in chains. The rival governments who sought to carve up our country have been defeated, their ambitions reduced to ashes. The people of Mexico are no longer pawns in their ruthless game. The future is now ours to shape.\n\nThis is a new dawn for Mexico - a Mexico free from the terror of cartels and the corruption of past governments. We have fought for this moment with our blood and our will, and now we will begin the arduous task of rebuilding a nation that has been torn apart.\n\nBut the fight is not yet over. Though we have won the war, the scars of conflict remain. We must be vigilant, ensuring that no remnants of the cartels or their supporters rise again to threaten our hard-earned peace. We must also build a government that is just and fair, one that will guide Mexico into a future of strength and prosperity.\nVictory is ours, but the real work has just begun."
 mexico.12.a: "Mexico is ours."
