The party organizations within the United Front currently continue to squabble with one another over who should undertake what role and how they'd do it, seemingly more enamored with the fact that the revolution has actually begun and how they envision its conclusion rather than the current situation at hand. With the current lack of an actual cabinet or definitive leadership outside of the APLA's militant commanders, nearly all of the basic affairs of state - much less any revolutionary policies - are almost entirely unable to be carried out, leaving the areas under our control in a state of perpetual chaos and disorganization."

While we are not without our supporters, a large number of people have voiced their discontent with the APLA's government, causing some broader disruptions on the home front and harming the will of the populace and our revolutionaries to see our struggle to completion.

From the most seasoned, well-read adherents to the freshest activists and believers in the revolutionary cause, most within the APLA hold their own ideas of a socialist society, leading to many, many instances of arguments and factionalism between comrades, now seen as merely expected for the left in general. Unfortunately, this attitude has seemingly carried over to the rank and file, even with the situation at hand. Revolutionaries in the field constantly bicker with one another over essentially everything, from the structure of their units themselves, to what tactics to use, to the never-ending speculation of how they should be carrying out the revolution itself. Such quarreling has led to our forces being heavily disorganized, if not enthusiastic about taking the fight to our enemies."

As such, many of these workers and executive leaders have fled our territory, taking their industry expertise with them.

Worsening the problem is the trafficking of drugs into the United States through the Mexican Cartels, something that has only been exasterbated by the recent crises in the Mexican Government, leading to a growing Cartel presence in the American Southwest. With decades of failed policy implemented by the California DNC, major cities such as Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Francisco have been hotbeds for the drug trade, with discarded needles and heroin usage visible on the streets.\n\nNow, with the revolution sweeping across California, a bright future may lie ahead for America.

With a collapsing economy, a looming climate catastrophe, and a bleak future ahead of the American people, thousands of young people have turned towards drugs as a way to cope with their problems. Worsening the problem is the trafficking of drugs into the country by Mexican cartels, and into the hands of street gangs and other drug rings, something that has only been exacerbated by the crime spree and the San Quentin riot. With decades of failed policy implemented by the California DNC, major cities such as Sacramento, Los Angeles and San Francisco have been hotbeds for the drug trade, with discarded needles and heroin usage visible on the streets, and their suppliers still ever present.\n\nNow, with the revolution sweeping across California, a bright future may lie ahead. It is the responsibility of the American People's Liberation Army to end the War on Drugs, although exactly how is entirely up in the air."

 #Leader Desc
 POLITICS_MIKE_PRYSNER_DESC: "Michael Prysner was born in Buffalo, New York. He grew up in a working-class family and lived the normal life of a patriotic red-blooded American.\n\nThat is, until he went to Iraq.\n\nAt the age of 18 Prysner served as a corporal in the 10th Mountain Division from 2003 to 2004. During his deployment, he witnessed the devastating effects of the war on Iraqi civilians. After countless home raids, surveillance missions and interrogations, he became disillusioned with the U.S. military's mission. After returning to the United States in 2005, Prysner was honorably discharged from the Army, and he spoke out against the war in his \"Our Real Enemies\" Speech.\n\nIn 2006, Prysner co-founded the organization \"March Forwards\" , which was made up of veterans and active-duty service members who opposed the war. He also became involved with ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), a coalition of anti-war and social justice groups. His first great test came when he confronted the monster George W. Bush that sent him to war. His demands for an apology for lies about 9/11 and WMDs were met with silence from the ex-President, but his cries of \"You sent me to Iraq\" and \"My friends are dead because you lied.\" echoed in the ears of many. His second great test begins now. As temporary leader of the American People's Liberation Army, High ranking PSL member, and former soldier of the United States, he has taken up arms to liberate the people of America once and for all and save the country he loves. He has tried to reason with his enemies with words, but he now knows that §Rviolence is the only thing they understand.§!"

It was his job to sort them and afterwards dispose of those he had been ordered to. He stood, anxiously waiting to find out which ones had made the cut. Being bored, he popped open the suitcase and looked down at the painting. Seemingly they had been put in reverse order as the painting of Washington was the one on top. It truly was a beautiful work of art, the brushwork was done masterfully, the color was pleasing to the eye, the light and shadow had been done very skillfully. What a shame it would be, he thought, to destroy such a magnificent portrait. It wasn't long before the order came. He had been given a long, thin piece of paper by a commanding officer. On it was a list of 45 names, but only two commands. "PRESERVE" or "DESTROY". The list had been done with the most recent presidents on top, and he had to first skim through the list to find out Washington's fate. The most recent presidents were marked for destruction, as was Reagan and all of the cold war presidents for that matter, though they seemingly had made an exception for Kennedy. FDR and Teddy Roosevelt were to be preserved also. McKinnley through Hayes were all condemned, but Licoln and Grant were saved. He at last came to the bottom of the list, and much to his relief, Washington had been marked "PRESERVE". He placed the painting aside and pulled out the next one. It was one of John Adams. He took a quick look at the list and saw that this one had been marked "DESTROY". Oh well, he thought, this one wasn't nearly as nice anyways."

Seeing that that a great deal of the proletariat under the APLA have been mislabeled as reactionary by the rest of the government for their social views, the Jacobins seek to combine socially conservative views with progressive economic policy. Combining §YAmerican Patriotism§! with a socialism, they advocate for socially conservative policies under the idea that social progressivism is neoliberal in nature, corroding the values held dear by the working class.\n\nThe $APA_octoberist_plural$ are a collection of §YMarxist-Leninist§! groups that have been operating from before the revolution, such as the §YPSL§! and the §YFRSO§!. Similar to the Jacobins, they too want a §YDictatorhsip of the Proletariat§!, with a vanguard party made up of ideologically comitted Communists leading the nation. While inter-party democracy will exist through the form of §YDemocratic Centralism§!, the average worker will not have a direct say in government, instead being represented by elected officials. However, they remain comitted to the ideas of Feminism and LGBT liberation, unlike the Jacobins.\n\nThe $APA_anarchist_plural$ are the most radical group of them all, wishing to see the immediate transition to §RCommunism§!, skipping the stage of socialism. Culturally, they see American Culture as $APA_reactionary_name$ and advocating for a §RCultural Revolution§! targeting any and all elements of American Culture seen as oppressive. The Radical-Sakaist wing of the Black Bloc, is a §YPost-Marxist§! one, which wishes to see the dissolution of the §RSettler-Colonial§! state and a complete decolonization of the United States.\n\nThe $APA_neosocialist_plural$ are communists who wish to build socialism on top of the current liberal constitutional framework. Rather than burning the current constitution down and writing a new one in place of it, the Neosocialists wish to write the §YBill of Rights Socialism§! which adds a progressive framework to the current US Constitution.

Although both units have been put under military arrest and are held in actively at the San Francisco Base Area by military police, it is only indicative of a larger problem.\n\nUnity between brigades of various tendencies has been tenuous at best, and combat effectiveness has been at an all time low due to disagreements about tactics, organization and goals. Although incidents such as the one between the John Brown Battalion and the Catgirl Battalion are rare, the very fact they exist has led for many to call for a complete military reorganization, placing the military under the direct command of the Central Committee instead of the decentralized structure that exists right now. Detractors on the other hand, worry that a military reorganization would hamper the revolutionary efforts, and that the focus must be on the defeat of the reactionaries that occupy the rest of the US."

Army ammunition has been standardized, and proper supply lines, logisitic teams and communication systems have been set up. The army will run as a well oiled machine, serving the cause of the revolution rather than groups of small individual guerillas.

The funds of the APLA have been running on a knifes edge - propped up by Chinese, Venezuelan and Cuban support, and facing increasingly high civilian discontent due to the high taxes needed to keep the APLA up and running.\n\nInside the Central Committee, a proposal has been whispered around. With the destruction of the several drug cartels in recently liberated territory, there lay a high demand for drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamines  and heroin. In the absence of the  cartels and gangs, an underground economy has begun to form - one completely untaxed by the APLA, dangerous and unregulated. The anarchists have submitted a proposal calling for the legalization of all drugs, citing the rights of the individual to choose. Pushed along with a compromise from the Octoberists, the APLA government would have the ability to control the sale and distribution. Supporters of the bill have cited the benefits to the economy, as the profits from the drug trade can be used to support the struggling economy. However, the Neosocialists and Jacobins have formed a united opposition, with the former citing the destruction of the drug trade on black and indigenous communities, accusing thee supporters of being \"pseudo-reaganites who wish to smuggle crack into the cities like the CIA\"and the latter calling drugs the \"literal opiate of the masses\", citing how the ideal worker was not one of hedonistic laziness, doped up constantly, but a sober one who worked for their community."

A divisive issue among all political factions, three main proposals have been proposed.\n\nThe first proposal is to expand the power of the executive. Supporters of this measure tend to be mostly Jacobins and Octoberists, with some radical Neosocilaists mixed in. While many of its detractors worry that a powerful executive may cause a dictatorship to form like it did in countries such as North Korea or the USSR, its proponents state that a strong leader is necessary for times where hard decisions need to be made. With the fires of revolution burning throughout California, a strong leader is needed to lead the country into it's red future.\n\nThe second proposal is one mainly put forth by the Neosocialists and some Octoberists, who state that the powers of the executive should remain the same as the original American constitution. The problem with the capitalist system was not its presidential powers, but rather the power of Wall Street. A president which is checked by the Workers Congress, yet still has the power to pass or veto legislation seems ideal, and should be kept. Going to far either way would disrupt the careful checks and balances that serve as the bedrock for American democracy. However, opponents say that continuing the past systems makes the revolution pointless, and that they are bound to repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nFinially, the Anarchist proposal is to strip away most, if not all, power away from the Executive, nd transfer i over to the Worker's Congress. They argue that the very idea of a leader goes against Communist ideals, as no man should have power over another. The country should be run collectively by its people, whether that be through direct or representative democracy. Like the others, its too has many opponents, most of which argue that leaving such a leak executive would make for endless governmental infighting and policy deadlock, as well as no guiding figure for the nation."

 apla.35.d: "Throughout the history of the United States, the Supreme Court has simultaneously been one of the most progressive institutions, pushing forwards Civil Rights throughout the 1960s and 70s, while at other times being a reactionary institution that has limited reforms and strengthened the capitalist system. On paper, the Supreme Court serves as a valuable part of the delicate checks and balances system that holds American Democracy toghether, yet during the Trump Presidency it showed a dangerous ability to be subverted by the elements of reaction. Now, with the reconstruction of the Constitution, lawmakers must once again decide the role of the court.\n\nA unexpected coalition of Anarchists and Jacobins has formed in order to abolish the Supreme Court, calling the idea of a triad of unelected judges deciding the fate of millions undemocratic at its very core. They have strongly advocated for the abolition of the court, and moving more power to the legislative bodies, whether that be the Worker's Congress or the local Council Republics. While the abolition of the court may improve popular representation and allow for policy to be passed quicker, opponents are concerned with the possibility that the lack of Judicial oversight may lead to a subversion of the democratic process. On the other side, the Neosocialists and Octoberists have argued that the court should remain in place, albiet with reforms in order to protect the system from being subverted by enemies of the proletariat."

 apla.36.d: "The next step in solidifying the revolution is the creation of the mechanism in which the people will be represented in government. As one of the most divisive issues in the American People's Liberation Army, four different proposals have come through.\n\nThe first proposal is headed by the Anarchists, who favor the voting of policies directly through the people. While the legislators in the Worker's Congress will still draft and propose legislation, the final votes on them will be done by the people. Especially with the introduction of the internet, voting can be done quicker and easier than ever, while making sure the entire population is represented.\n\nThe second proposal is one of syndicalism - that instead of representation through geographical proximity, voting be done through trade union representatives. Voting for representatives would be done among trade unions, who would each be given proportional representation depending on the size of their respective fields.\n\nThe third proposal is put forth by primarily the Neosocialists and Octoberists, who argue that a popular vote would elect representatives based on geographical area, who would then go onto serve in the Workers Congress. While this system would work similarly to the old voting system of the United States, signifigant voting reform would be passed, such as first-past the post victories, publically funded canidates, the declaration of Voting Day as a national holiday, and the end of gerrymandering.\n\nFinially, the proposal put forwards by the Jacobins and various Octoberists seeks to mimic the system as seen in China, where elections would only happen on a local county level. Elected officials would be able to rise through the bureaucracy if they preform well, allowing for a bureaucratic meritocracy to ensure optimal governance."

Since Trade Unions have been a force which has historically advanced the socialist cause, the integration of trade unionism into the APLA will form a solid foundations to calibrate the economy and protect worker's rights.\n\nDue to wartime conditions, a coalition of Octoberists and Jacobins have proposed that all unions be officially sponsored by the state. They argue that under a socialist system, the party should be the primary means of worker representation, and the trade unions should be the bodies in which the party can organize the economy. While this will increase the efficency of the economy, many worry that workers rights will not be protected without independent unions.\n\nOn the other hand, the Neosocialists and Anarchists have argued that independent unions are the only way to protect workers rights. They worry that state-run workers will not fight the state economy for better conditions for their workers, and thus there needs to be organs of worker power independent of the state. However, detractors worry that independent unions may be subverted by anti-communist elements."

 apla.42.d: "During the advance of the American People's Liberation Army across California, resistance has varied significantly, from drug cartels and prison gangs to state government remnants and national guard units. One of the fiercest opponents of the APLA within California has been the California State Militia, which has specifically prioritized destroying the communists at any cost. With the state government losing control of large swaths of land in Northern California, the militia has stepped in as a force to stabilize the region.\n\n Recently, after gaining control of the region, the California State Militia decided to 'evacuate' seemingly almost the entire population of California's northwestern coastal county of Humboldt during an ongoing offensive by the APLA. The California State Militia claims that they did so to protect the civilians in the region and deny any allegations of otherwise, but both APLA and international observers decried the action, declaring it an act of forced deportion and genocide against minorities and left wingers, as the northwest coast of California is largely left leaning and is home to a high minority population. The APLA even went as far to suggest that the CSM had deported the population to extermination camps deep in the Sierra Nevada, although evidence for this is lacking. Regardless of the exact details, the event is sure to lead to greater levels of political and ethnic violence throughout California and the west coast region as a whole, as  leftist militants may seek to avenge the incident by targeting right wing civilian populations with similar acts."

Not only that, but the men and women of our units all seem to fully understand the ideological struggle we are engaged in, and that the future of not only the socialist movement, but that of humanity depends on the unity of our cause.  However, I have noted that many of the regiment's companies now have begun to freely loot vast quantities of riches from the houses and offices of the billionaires that have fallen under our control.\n\nWhile I do admit that there is some poetic justice in our brave fighters seizing the wealth that these fascists have squeezed from the people, I also understand that the wealth belongs to the people in general, not just individual soldiers. There is a danger that if we allow looting to go unpunished, we will look like nothing less than an army of bandits and common thieves, which would severely harm the credibility of our struggle in the eyes of the populace. On the other hand, stopping this looting would greatly aid the image of our army to the people, and likely increase the amount of personnel we can recruit. However, this would potentially damage the war effort itself, as it might reduce the morale of our men and reduce our combat effectiveness.\n\nThe commander of the regiment is ready to bring an end to the looting if such an action is deemed necessary. He has discussed with me the use of flogging to punish any further offenders, and exile to penal battalions or labor camps for repeat offenders. He has personally asked me in my capacity as the regimental commissar to write a report describing this behavior and the potential consequences, so that high command could come to a proper decision on the matter."

It appears that reputation will no longer hold, as the advancing American People's Liberation Army has finally seized the famous neighborhood after a short period of heavy fighting. The neighborhood was already severely damaged by the mortar and artillery shells of the APLA forces, as well as the firefights that occured within Beverly HIlls itself, but the APLA has done even more damage after capturing it. Many of the houses have been desecrated with communist and pro-APLA as well as anticapitalist imagery, and large amounts of luxury goods that were left behind have been confisticated by the communist forces, including highly expensive cars like Ferraris and Lamborghinis, high quality jewelry, and antique paintings.\n\nAlthough none of the residents appear to have remained behind to face the fury of the APLA, there were several reported incidents of private security and guards who stayed behind facing violence after being captured. In one startling video, a group of what appears to be five private security contractors, who were referred to as \"fascist mercenaries\" in the video were blindfolded, put against a wall, and shot. The APLA itself denies releasing the video, claiming it to be \"capitalist war propaganda\", but there have been calls abroad demanding an international investigation into the incident. Regardless, the APLA's advance in California continues, despite dagged resistance from the state government, militias, gangs, and mercenaries."

Of course, we cannot ignore the more outlandish conspiracy theories surrounding it, ritual sacrifices and the satanic elite are the common ones that the far right believes in the most. However, we cannot verify that for the only dead we found there were the grove's security detail after they resisted our forces.Still, it remains a symbol of capitalism, the so-called owl of wisdom still stands there as a totem of opression, almost mocking anyone it looks over.\n\nThe Neosocialists believe that the eurocentric aspects of the grove such as the wood carving of John of Nepomuk and the owl of wisdom should be decommissioned and that the place should be abandoned all together, killing off reactionary conspiracy theories and aim to let nature simply reclaim the grove.\n\nThe anarchists on the other wish to see all of the grove's former territory be returned to the Karuk people, seeing it as a symbolic first step to give the stolen land back to the indigenous tribes of America, what they do with the cabins and other eurocentric symbols is up for them to decide.\n\nThe Octoberists see the natural beauty of the place and wish to reshape it into state property for the people to freely visit and see the place that has been secluded for so long, historic context will be given to the buildings and other objects in order to show that the rich and powerful were just a group of weirdos, taking away the symbolic power the reactionary conspiracy theories gave them.\n\nThe Jacobins have a very simple approach to it, they wish to publically burn down the icon of capitalism, for not only would this destroy the decade-old legacy of the enemy, it would also be extremely cathartic for the more conservative minded people who still believe in the conspiracy theories surrounding the place."

The movie featured characters who are from well known franchises such as Star wars, Marvel and Disney, what was noticeable was that most actors for these characters were actually present in the movie such as Harrison Ford, viewers noted that Ford showed actual passion in the role.\n\nThe plot of the movie is about a young male obsessed with pop culture media to the point he neglected his own responsibilities, eventually he was visited by \"a revolutionary spirit\"that proceeded to show his future if he kept on this path. The movie ended with all characters such as Mickey Mouse, Spiderman and Iron man getting gunned down and the man being able to grow up - a controversial \"canonical\" ending to the Marvel, Disney and greater Hollywood Franchises.\n\nDisney and Marvel among other companies have already denounced the movie and seek to delete every instance of it online. Despite these efforts the movie has been spread across the internet and has been both praised and hated for several reasons, for some it is an open critique towards mass consumerism while for others it is considered a direct assault on democracy.\n\nReports of actors such as Harrison Ford have expressed great gratitude towards the APLA as he said that \"I'm finally free of those shitty characters\" The 2nd American Civil War continues as another oddity of the conflict has been added to the history books."

This came as a surprise to our soldiers, as the gang had been fighting tooth and nail resisting our advance, but once in custody Mr. White requested to speak with an officer. The officer he spoke to sent Mr.White's message to the high command of the army; the message being an offer of the BGF's loyalty and service in exchange for a full pardoning of all of  the organization's members.\n\nThis has caused quite the stir within the high command, as officers loyal to the Octoberists or the Anarchists advocate for the absorption of the Black Guerilla Family into the Liberation army, seeing it as an opportunity to reach out to other former gangsters and support the ideals of the old Rainbow Coalition.

With intense debate raging both within the halls of the Revolutionary Congress and in online forums, it is necessary for the government to finally come to an action.\n\nOpponents of the strike have criticized the demands as unreasonable, as the government has very little to spare with all available funding and material being put forth to the revolutionary cause, and thus advocate for breaking the strike. While breaking the strike may be more cost efficient, it would certainly decrease the efficiency of the workers, as well as alienate other independent unions within the APLA.

In addition, many argue that such radical economic restructuring during the war would disrupt the APLA supply chains, something that would severely damage the war effort. It is also argued that agreeing to these demands will enable the anarchists to enforce their demands on the government, regardless of their own legitimacy and lack of electoral success - essentially allowing a minority faction to run the government.\n\nNevertheless, a small faction within the Neosocialists argue that the harms that these strikes could do to the government outweigh the potential risks of agreeing to their demands.

Although the country has had a troublesome and violent past, the new policy seeks to promote the progressive parts of American history, from the labor struggles of the Gilded Age, to the fight against fascism during the Second World War.

Thanks to the efforts of the local party office, an orderly distribution of food and water has been arranged, casting away the chaos and looting of the first few months of the war. Many small buisnesses within the city have been collectivized, running as cooperatives with workplace democracy, while the larger buisnesses have been absorbed by the government for the war effort. I recently interviewed a young owner of one of these stores named Ren. She was one of the younger liberators to serve in the fall of San Diego to our forces.\n\nThis story and so many more serve as a perfect example as to our eventual triumph over Capitalism. Stories of workers slaving away on keyboards to their unrelenting masters. They toil endlessly for hours on end, and for pennies on the dime. This disgusting and time old form of exploitation is no more in the District.\n\nWhile conditions are harsh and abundancy of supplies is limited due to the ongoing war, a renewed sense of optimism has finially overcome the city.

Despite hosting the world's most prestigious universities, publishing thousands of papers each year, 54% of adults in the United States have prose literacy below the 6th-grade level. Worse, the cause of this problem lie in the American capitalist system - the high cost of four-year university make higher education unobtainable for most Americans, underpaid teachers caused by years of attacks on teacher unions have left schools critically understaffed, and a propagandized curriculum teaching american exceptionalism, creationism and anticommunism have Americans woefully ignorant about the reality of the world we live in. As such, the 28th Amendment completely reforms the education system of the United States, guaranteeing a four-year college education for every American citizen, the rights for teachers to unionize, and the nationalization of all educational institutions. Soon, the days where the rich can send their kids to private schools, sucking up resources away from the common man to give the young elite an unfair advantage in the so-called capitalist meritocracy will be long gone.

Specifically, the 29th Amendment guarantees the right to housing through a national housing guarantee, the right to unionize, the right to universal healthcare, and the right to work. These guarantees are the only way to ensure life and for true freedom to be felt in the United States. While these are lofty ideals that the government hopes to achieve, none can deny that these rights will be guaranteed overnight. Yet, all recognize that these liberties give millions the ability to decide their own destiny and work step-by-step to build new democratic institutions to run the economy.\n\nThe second part of the 29th Amendment secures further economic rights for the American worker. By implementing a constitutionally held wage cap, it is made sure that no person in a firm can be paid more than fifteen times the salary of the lowest employee.

The controversial vagueness has led many radical lawmakers to suggest that the amendment effectively nationalizes all land, and that the new government ought to take control of the agricultural sector. On the other hand, other lawmakers have argued that the purpose of the amendment is meant to collectivize the mining, logging and drilling industries - not farming. "

In an effort to gain support, policies spearheaded by the Center for Political Innovation to reconcile this historical opposition have begun to bear fruit.\n\nSeveral meetings between CPI officials and present clergy has been followed by a number of pro-church policies being enacted; media outlets and informational pamphlets likening the struggle and ideals of Jesus Christ as not only compatible but in direct accordance with the Marxist worldview have been placed into circulation throughout many cities and towns. A variety of literary works, discussion circles, and general encouragement by government figures and churches have been at the forefront of this effort to explore the nature of spirituality and its connection to revolutionary action, citing biblical sources preaching the evils of wealth and inequality and presenting the idea that capitalism as a whole is in opposition to Christ's teachings.\n\nAs a result of the sudden government outreach and involvement in church activities, an increasing number of priests, pastors, and other members of clergy have (albeit with some light \"encouragement\") begun endorsing the CPI's platform, preaching the ideals of the revolution to their flock. Thanks to this, many churchgoers, rural workers, and former reactionaries have slowly come around to the Jacobin set of ideals, supporting their efforts to preserve their faith.

Deviating from typical leftist orthodoxy of the other factions, the Neosocialists see the only way for Socialism to survive is through reforming the old institutions, preserving the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and ideals of old America in order to keep the legacy of Republicanism in America alive.\n\nSocialism is not meant to be enforced with an iron fist, but rather through compassion, peace and mutual understanding.

With anarchy englufing many major cities and towns, countless citizens have demanded for stability to return to their communities. Such demands must be met in order to ensure the legitimacy of the APLA in the eyes of the population. As such, the main debate amongst the provisional government is the nature of such a force - whether it be a centralized force, akin to the NKVD or Stasi, acting as the sword and shield of the revolution against reactionaries that seek to disrupt and destroy the socialist project, or for resources to be provided to communities where they can self govern and reinforce their existing self defense groups.\n\nThose in support of the centralized model highlight it's benefits of uniformity in law enforcement standards and practices, enhanced coordination and resource allocation and greater control over policing activities by the APLA high command. However, opponents say that this model has the potential  for abuse of power, the risk of fostering a climate of fear and mistrust among the population, and difficulties in adapting to local conditions and community needs.\n\nIn contrast, the community policing model offers greater community involvement and responsiveness to local needs, increased flexibility in adapting to unique challenges and situations and reduced risk of centralized corruption and abuse of power. However, the decentralized model also presents several challenges, including potential inconsistencies in law enforcement practices, difficulty in coordinating efforts and resources among different militia groups, and a lack of centralized oversight and control."

Yet, this kind of chaos only breeds fear, uncertainty, and instability, as the APLA attempts to establish a new state in the ashes of the old. Naturally, it is necessary to determine whether to encourage these courts or centralize the justice system.\n\nOne option for the APLA is to encourage the revolutionary courts, allowing them to continue trying enemies of the revolution autonomously. This approach has several potential benefits including empowering local communities and fostering a sense of ownership over the revolution, expediting the judicial process by distributing the caseload across multiple courts and potentially deterring counter-revolutionary activities by demonstrating swift justice. However, this sort of anarchaic justice inconsistencies in the application of justice, leading to potential miscarriages of justice or perceptions of unfairness. Especially in areas with minority populations, many worry such courts may encourge racial division.\n\nAlternatively, the APLA could choose to centralize the justice system, creating a single, unified structure for trying enemies of the revolution. This approach offers several advantages, such as ensuring consistency in the application of justice across APLA-controlled territories, enhancing oversight and regulation of the judicial process by the APLA high command and streamlining the justice system, potentially allowing for more efficient resource allocation. Unfortunately, the centralized system also has drawbacks including alienating local communities by removing their direct involvement in the judicial process, potentially slowing down the judicial process due to the concentration of cases in a centralized system and risking the emergence of a bureaucratic and inefficient judicial system, impeding the delivery of justice."

Synthesis anarchism was designed to attract the attention of communists, syndicalists and individualists. According to Synthesis anarchism, an anarchist federation must be heterogeneous and relatively poorly organized in order to preserve the individual autonomy of its members.\n\n-Anarcho-syndicalism is an organizational model that was used during the Spanish Civil War, which recognizes only the grassroots, non-hierarchical self-organization of workers and therefore rejects participation in government bodies, as well as political parties and hierarchical workers' unions.

We have the opportunity to grow into an actual standing army and we will take it with open hands, only then can we bring forth the torch of revolution."
