 CRO_slavoniadalmatia_divide: "Slavonia-Dalmatia Divide"
 CRO_slavoniadalmatia_divide_desc: "Our coastline is the shining gem of Croatia - with the crystal clear Adriatic and picturesque landscapes making for one of the top tourist destinations in Europe and one of the biggest sources of income for Croatia since 1991 - not to mention the massive shipbuilding industry in the biggest cities on the coast. The problem from this comparatively prosperous development was the neglect of the northern half of our country in the fertile valley of Slavonia, resulting in the lack of industry being developed and as such the region being largely left agrarian despite many untapped reserves of resources - the most glaring example of this divide being that only 2 out of 100 major Croatian businesses originate from Slavonia."
 CRO_european_reliance: "European Reliance"
 CRO_european_reliance_desc: "One of the flaws of a thriving tourist sector and a central bank turned into an exchange is the autark's biggest nightmare - reliance on other nations. Most of our economy relies on shipbuilding, tourism and transit, with our own industry exports making up only a quarter of our total GDP. Inevitably, Croatia has turned into a country reliant on the European Union both economically and politically, leaving little headroom for Croatia to assert itself as a regional power. Another consequence was a rise in populism amongst the people, frustrated at Croatia's politicians lack of interest in reducing overreliance and being nothing more than pawns of Brussels."
 CRO_fading_grudges: "Fading Grudges"
 CRO_fading_grudges_desc: "Croatia was one of the biggest participants of the Yugoslav wars, with our men on the frontlines battling Serbs and Bosnians in Slovenia and Central Yugoslavia. Now that the wars are over, and disputes started being solved in favour of partnership and collective ascension into the European Union, the rope on the powderkeg that is the Balkans seems to have lengthened exponentially at least for the northern parts of former Yugoslavia - with the Croatia-Serbia border dispute becoming dormant and the Slovenia sea zone border dispute being nothing more than an annoyance to local fishermen."
