Dissidence is rare, and most of the dissidents have opted to try and flee the country rather than resist from wtihin.\n\nOur "Military-First" policy has provided us with a bloated amount of army personal, allowing us to keep constant patrols at a cost. Our unending work of the propganda machine makes it so that anyone - may they be a soldier, officer, worker, cleaner, or a party bureaucrat; there is not a minute where their patriotism and love to the Party, Dear Leader, Military, and of the Socialist Paradise they are so lucky to live in and be shielded from the US and their imperialist puppet states.\n\nKim's Personality Cult is among the largest ever created, with an overwhelming amount of the populations remaining unquestionably loyal, they are ready to work, fight, and die for our Dear Comrade Leader. Perhaps they are even too loyal, and no one knows what would be the fate of the nation should §RKim perish suddenly...§!"

 korea.4.d: "The Second Korean War, which began in 2025, has reached a conclusion, with both North and South Korea unable to gain a significant advantage on the battlefield. The conflict, which erupted after South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel following the death of Kim Jong Un, has resulted in thousands of casualties and has drawn the attention of the international community with the intervention of both the PDTO and the EADI. Despite early successes by South Korean forces, including the capture of several border cities such as Haeju and Pyongsan, South Korean forces were quickly bogged down in the mountainous terrain of the North and what was expected to be a quick campaign turned into months of stalemate. A year since the end of the war, the EADI, PDTO and both Koreas have mediated an end to the conflict and a resolution to bring Korea under a united government - the People's Republic of Korea, named after the short-lived provisional government from 1945. For the first time in history, free, nationwide elections will be held across the entire peninsula, with international observeres. Both North and South Korean politicians will run for office as the new government of National Unity attempts to heal the wounds caused by 70 years of seperation."

 korea.6.d: "TSUSHIMA, Japan (AP) - In a stunning turn of events, North Korea has emerged victorious in a Second Korean War, crushing the South Korean and Japanese forces and establishing itself as the sole ruler of the Korean peninsula.\n\nThe conflict began in mid 2025, when tensions between the two Koreas reached a boiling point. Following the death of Kim Jong-Un and the North Korean Civil War, South Korean troops crossed the 38th Parallel expecting a quick victory, but were met with heavy resistance.\n\nDespite having a superior military in terms of both numbers and technology, as well as being backed by the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, Chinese assistance quickly turned the KPA into a modern military force capable of fighting back. Using a combination of guerilla tactics, cyber warfare, and sheer force of will, combined PLA and KPA forces repelled the PDTO volunteers from Pyongyang, and crossed into the South, encircling and crushing many PDTO regiments.\n\nThe aftermath of the conflict is still unclear, but it is expected that the DPRK will use its newfound power to exert even greater control over its population and continue its aggressive foreign policy. The PDTO, meanwhile, will likely face a crisis of confidence as it grapples with the loss of one of its key allies in the region."

 korea.7.d: "SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - In a stunning victory for the Korean people, the Republic of Korea has emerged triumphant in the Second Korean War against its northern neighbor, North Korea. The conflict, which began in 2025, saw the deployment of tens of thousands of troops, as well as the use of advanced military technology on both sides.\n\nThe victory came after months of intense fighting, with both sides suffering heavy losses. The North Korean military, which had long been seen as a paper tiger, was eventually overwhelmed by the superior technology and tactics of the South Korean military, as well as the support of its allies.\n\nTensions between the two Koreas reached a breaking point following the death of Kim Jong Un and the flood of thousands of refugees across the South Korean border as the North decended into Anarchy. Seizing upon their chance to reunify the country, the Republic of Korea Armed Forces crossed the 38th Parallel into the North for the first time in over 70 years.\n\nAs the war dragged on, both sides suffered significant losses. North Korean forces, which were heavily reliant on outdated military technology, were unable to match the firepower of the South Korean military and its allies. Meanwhile, the South Korean military utilized advanced weapons systems and tactics, including drones and cyberattacks, to gain the upper hand."

 korea.8.t: "Korea Joins the EADI"
 korea.8.d: "SEOUL, People's Republic of Korea (AP) - Korea has officially joined the East Asian Defense Initiative, a military alliance led by China, raising concerns about the country's security alignment with its longtime liberal allies in the region. Newly elected President Sim Sang-jung, a South Korean left-wing labor rights activist announced the decision in a television broadccast before the newly united nation.\n\nFollowing the end of the Second Korean War, which was ended by a ceasefire between the North and the South resulting in the newly created People's Republic of Korea heralded a new chapter for the Peninsula. While many expected the establishment bloc of the Democratic Party of Korea to win, anti-Japanese sentiment dominated the election after reports of atrocities committed by PDTO were released to the public. Decreased trust in liberal institutions, following decades of economic frustration among South Korea's lower class and the desires of the North to preserve elements of their socialist system ultimately led the left wing Korean Social Democratic Party to seat itself in a position of power.\n\n\"The EADI is an important initiative that will contribute to regional peace and stability\", Sim said in a statement.\"South Korea's participation will enhance our defense capabilities and deepen our ties with China and other member countries.\""

The organization also includes Australia and New Zealand.Korea's decision to join the PDTO comes amid growing tensions with China, which has been increasing its military and economic clout in the region. The news comes amid nationwide anger about Chinese cyberattacks comitted during the Second Korean War, as well as atrocities comitted by Chinese troops during their intervention in the North Korean Civil War.\n\n\"We believe that peace on the Korean Peninsula is essential for regional peace and stability\" Yoon said. \"We will continue to work towards that goal, while also strengthening our defense capabilities through our participation in the PDTO.\""
