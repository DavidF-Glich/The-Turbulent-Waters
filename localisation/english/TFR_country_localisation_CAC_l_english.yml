 CAC_cascadian_militias_idea: "Cascadian Militias"
 CAC_cascadian_militias_idea_desc: "Prior to the outbreak of the civil war, many within the Northwest began to form self-defense militias in the case of an emergency or to combat a tyrannical government. Now that authority in Washington and Oregon has collapsed, many people, from all walks of life, have flocked to our ranks, believing that we are the only group capable of providing sufficient defense and an ample supply of food and water. This, of course, comes at the price of experience, with a large portion of our army caring little for Cascadia and only fighting for the chance at finding loot or a filled soup bowl."

 #Leader Desc
 POLITICS_MIKE_MA_DESC: "Born in October 1995, Mike Ma was a known troublemaker in his youth and despite being barred from his high school graduation, he received a diploma on the grounds that he stayed home for the rest of senior year. A year later, he was accepted into the US Coast Guard. After going through their boot camp twice, once as squad leader, he was medically discharged for sleepwalking into restricted territory.\n\nIt was then that he became lost in the world. Jaded, beaten, and without a college degree. He began to write, both in fiction and politics. It got him a few jobs with decent pay, and later evolved into better jobs with outstanding pay. But like all good things, those came to an end. So here he is; thrown back into the world of uncertainty.\n\nUntil now.\n\nThe world is burning and in times of great crisis great conquerers are born out of the flames, Mike Ma intends to be just that, seeing the damage the modern world has done to his tribe, he is dedicated to bring forth a great transformation to society to revive classical morality and aesthetics, to lean further into the collapse of the modern world and most importantly to allow Mother Nature to reclaim what was taken from her for so many centuries. The end justifies the means, millions will pay for the damage they have done to the natural order and balance will be restored.\n\nHaving written books that mocked an exaggerated version of himself, he soon came to realize he needed to be that exact version of himself in order stoke up the flames of change even further, no longer will he be the young writer stuck in populism, no longer will he be comedic vine star, he will be a new Mike Ma, the architect of harassment, the engine of acceleration and a bright flame that burns all, he intends to start the greatest fire the world has ever seen so that even in defeat he will leave his mark on history, just like the ancient conquerors did.\n\nThe modern world is his greatest adversary, and he does not intend to lose."

 cac.1.t: "The Grassroots Republic"
 cac.1.d: "Our newly-born nation will not have an easy awakening.\n\nIn the struggle for the national liberation of Cascadia, we have discovered the tenuous political foundation we stand on. We've may have put aside some of our differences but Cascadia still remains a land sharply divided by political extremes. There are several groups formed that adhere to extremism, left or right, and their ideas are beginning to slowly resonate with the people. Our republic was built on the people, by the people, and for the people, so we must expect some political outliers here and there.\n\nOne thing though that is much more imminent is the political division within the military. The fighting forces liberating our homeland have their own separate allegiances to ideas and figures besides their oath to Cascadia. There are Fascists, Socialists, and plethora of others in between. \n\nWe would be wise to do something to make sure it doesn't derail our chances of independence."
 cac.1.a: "Let's hope this extremism all blows over."
 
 cac.2.t: "The Forwards Cascadia Coalition Wins!"
 cac.2.d: "The election results have come in, and it shows the Coalition winning the popular vote! While the 2 other parties were a bit slow, they had nominally conceded defeat and allow the government to change. Being a coalition of different ideologies that share the same democratic values, it is expected that Cascadia will stand out as a safe heaven to many fleeing the civil war unfolding across the continental United States.\n\nHowever, a coalition like this one will have to compromise a lot to expect itself to keep some semblance of stability. Yet, due to there being three factions with opposing values under the same political umbrella, compromise is almost impossible. The Progressives and Libertarians have two different economic and welfare approaches, Conservatives and Libertarians disagree on military policy, social policy is a nightmare with Progressives and Conservatives, and so on and so on. Not an ideal way to start with a freshly made democracy, but at least there's democracy to begin with… Right?"

We have been fighting in a United Front for a while, and the political landscape has seemingly calmed down enough for such an election.\n\nWe currently have:\n\nThe Fowards Cascadia Coalition: A Centrist coalition of Progressives, Libertarians and Conservatives. They seek to guide casadia and ensure it's liberty\n\nThe Cascadian Socialist Party: The remaining socialists within our country have reorganised into a single party early on. They seek to ""depose capitalism within and abroad.""\n\nThe Imperative Party of Cascadia: Neofascist and Far-Right brigades have recently coalesced into a potential dark horse contender of the election.

I remember when some of them would be all giggly and teeming with excitement as they destroyed more and more.\n\nWell I don't wonder that anymore, when I lit the fuse of this red bundle of dynamite and tossed it into a King County Administration Building, I got pretty excited, even more so when the front of the building blew up, glass shattered everywhere, wood and concrete scattered everywhere, knowing the owners were trapped inside just was the icing on the cake.\n\nI get it, creating and destroying are one of the same, it takes creativity in one's methods in how you create and how you destroy, the unabomber was creative, nero was creative and just like these grandmasters of the destructive arts I will make a masterpiece. I'm in luck, for Seattle provides plenty of canvas.\n\nWell really, the entirety of the former US will.\n\nUp next is the Space Needle, always hated that thing, never understood man's obsession with wanting to be in space or to reach the heavens while paradise is here on this green earth, mimicking a concrete tree it's an affront to existence.\n\nGood thing all you need is a single trigger and a lot of explosives."

Another golem to the grandmasters, he only delayed the inevitable, foreigners still rampage through our lands and our natural environment grows uglier by the day. How can democracy work if the rulers aren't part of your tribe?\n\nCascadia remains a beautiful piece of earth, no really, I am convinced if you dragged some soy-consuming urban dweller to these lands that they'd burst into tears and beg for forgiveness for worshiping the icons of sin and decay. However a major mistake people have made here is that they try to walk the same path the federal government has walked, eventually more hives will spawn here, more cultural rot will set in, and I will never regret getting rid of these people, they would have done the same to me.\n\nThese people are pure evil, wearing masks of fake smiles and venom in their blood, we have seen them plenty of times and we learned how to deal with them, my tribe has left them in the dust and just like they piss on our history, our heritage, I will do the same on their pathetic constitution, a cheap copy of what the United States used to care about. I wonder how long it will take before it starts to disintigrate.\n\nThen after that, hundreds of new trees will be planted, the benefit of having so much fresh fertilizer is that they will grow to be beautiful healthy trees, they will appreciate the nutrition our foes will provide, especially the fat ones."

I intend to be one of those vultures.\n\nLooking at the hive named Seattle, the tumors were plentiful and expected. Crime and hedonism was present everywhere you looked, foreigners destroying what little cultural landmarks there were and of course ideological parasites defacing our once great nation.\n\nNot to mention the ivory towers trying to pierce the heavens, trash bags, a vomiting hobo or blue haired whales screaming in public, and of course a random tree here and there because even the most psychopathic city planner realizes that Man needs Nature, but even that they plan to remove, for the sake of control.\n\nIt's not all their fault though, just like the smaller scavengers you also have the big ones. Fat-faced oligarchs greedily shaking their oily hands as they get more funding by choking out the forests with more concrete blocks, politicians squeezing out as much money as possible out of the working man and foreign puppet masters playing with our offspring to their own fantasies, not that it matters much, both of these will meet their end.\n\nI know there are more people like me out there, all of us know what is coming and we have physically and mentally prepared for this for years.\n\nThe blueprints for accelerationism are there, it is up to us to demolish, and to rebuild."

No, I stand here like the conquerors of old who just vanquished their greatest adversary, after each taken city they would loot what is valuable and torch the urban hive, however the cities of old atleast had something worth preserving, this however is one of the many gravestones of a once dead civilization.\n\nLike a hungry lion who is watering at the thought of plunging its fangs into the neck of its prey, I am just as hungry to exact a long and terrible torture upon this cursed place. Nothing will be looted, all will be destroyed, we will set the entire city aflame, there will be a nine-eleven every hour upon every skyscraper, every lamppost will be decorated with our bloated enemies, every subway tunnel will be collapsed as the ocean reclaims its long lost territory, I hope the salt water can wash away every single sin of every single New Yorker that has ever walked there, every single bit of explosives will be used upon the concrete hellscape.\n\nRockets, grenades, molotov cocktails, napalm and the planes filled with martyrs, everything that can contribute to the total annihilation of New York City will be used, for too long has this disgusting city set its roots upon our beautiful Earth, burn, destroy and maim till not even a single bit of evidence is left that there ever was a city, cover the burnt earth with salt, the hipsters may cry, the fat retards can weep, the entire world can watch in shock, I don't care and neither does my tribe.\n\nMy path has led me to this, the climax of my path to acceleration, no mercy, no brakes. And low and behold, the ultimate icon of modern sin is set ablaze, but it will not stop here, every single piece of evidence we can find of New York City to exist will be scrubbed off public records, news papers, books and landmarks even remotely hinting towards its former existence will crumble by the combined might of fire and steel.\n\nAnd after that, with enough time passed, the historical filth will be gone from our minds, our children won't know better and the world can sigh in relief, knowing one of the many explosive cysts of modernity are gone, forever it will be known as the gravestone of modernity.\n\nAnd I could not be more happy."

Almost immediately after receiving the news, many of our generals have begun preparations for an oncoming invasion, and several militia groups, of all allegiances, have chosen to put aside their differences and band together.
