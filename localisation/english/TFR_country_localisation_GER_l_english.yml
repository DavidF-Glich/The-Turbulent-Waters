 GER_rethinking_german_militarism: "Rethinking German Militarism"
 GER_rethinking_german_militarism_desc: "German militarism, especially in the 20th and 21st centuries, is an incredibly sensitive topic. From the armies of the Kaiserreich who had viciously plundered Belgium and slaughtered millions under colonial rule in Namibia, to Adolf Hitler's regime which perpetrated the Holocaust; even bringing up remilitarization can get you labeled as a member of the far-right in the modern day. Despite its history and negative connotations, we should begin rethinking the state of German militarism with the position we have found ourselves in, especially as the United States is on the verge of collapse and the Russian bear looming over Europe."
 GER_bulwark_of_democracy: "Bulwark of Democracy"
 GER_bulwark_of_democracy_desc: "In the modern world, we have evolved into a beacon of European parliamentary democracy, standing proudly as the world's third-largest economy, especially in the aftermath of the United States' collapse. This has prompted us to begin reconsidering our historical aversion to militarization, especially with Russian expansionism and authoritarianism encroaching on the borders of democratic Europe. This is not merely a strategic adjustment, but a necessary measure to safeguard the future of German liberty, which should stand as a bulwark above all of Europe which will defend our people from the Eastern menace that has threatened the development of mankind for so long. While collaboration with our European allies is important, we must reiterate that the future of Germany is the future of Europe, and that Germany is to be valued first, atleast in our own affairs."
 GER_europe_united: "Europe United"
 GER_europe_united_desc: "As the United States is in open-air collapse, and Russia ready to strike the heart of European democracy at any second, we need now more than ever European unity. It has become clear that on its own, Europe is weak, susceptible to infighting and collapse. The European Union has been the bulwark of European democracy, and has manifested a parliamentary system that serves the will of the people with little flaws. If we want to secure the future of European liberty, aswell as strike down Russian expansionism before it can extend itself, the destiny of Europe is unity, and European collective defense will be valued over the state of the Bundeswehr."
 GER_defender_20_europe: "DEFENDER-Europe 20"
 GER_defender_20_europe_desc: "Defender-Europe is a concept drawn up by our High Command that involves a large-scale, Bundeswehr-led, multinational joint exercise designed to prepare Europe for a future war with \"adversaries abroad\", referring to none other than Russia. Not only would this plan build up the Bundeswehr and reinvigorate confidence within European militaries, it would build interoperability, readying Europe for joint military action in future conflicts. If accepted, this would structure European military exercises around the Bundeswehr, giving us an opportunity to show the competency and efficiency of our Army to the world."
 GER_f35_program: "F-35 Program"
 GER_f35_program_desc: "With the revitalization of the German Army, we should also pivot attention to the Luftwaffe, a branch of our Armed Forces which is critically underfunded, undersupplied, and neglected, despite the importance of an Air Force in modern warfare; particularly the F-35 Lightning II, a staple of American engineering genius as well as arguably the most successful stealth fighter program in human history. Using an influx of American military engineers fleeing the country due to the Civil War, blueprints, aswell as stockpiles across Europe, we will acquire our own set of F-35s, investing in our industry and workers, aswell as bolstering our military-industrial complex. This decision will make it clear that the F-35 is the right choice for Germany!"
 GER_revive_the_deutsche_marine: "Revive the Deutsche Marine"
 GER_revive_the_deutsche_marine_desc: "The Deutsche Marine, while one of the largest in Europe and extremely flexible, is overstretched, underfunded, and outdated. Years of cuts in the defense budget have significantly reduced the scope of our navy, as well as placed heavy restrictions on equipment. While we are rethinking German militarism, we should also extend this to the Navy, and begin upping our defense budget to revitalize the German Navy. We will invest in the modernization and expansion of our naval fleet, including the acquisition and development of advanced surface ships, submarines, and support vessels. We will also develop a clear and adaptable maritime doctrine that aligns with Germany's strategic interests above Europe's."
 GER_redefine_german_doctrine: "Redefine German Doctrine"
 GER_redefine_german_doctrine_desc: "German military doctrine, despite our efficient High Command, has been very obviously on the decline. Instead of adapting old techniques from separate countries, we should value and develop German military doctrines that suit the Bundeswehr best. This includes Joint Operations Integration, hybrid warfare, strategic mobility, the development of ISR and HADR, adaptation to electronic warfare, the development of urban battle techniques, multi-domain operations, and a flexible force structure. If we align the domestic priorities of the Bundeswehr, instead of doctrines developed in foreign nations, then the Bundeswehr will know best, allowing us to more efficiently adapt to foreign conflict."
 GER_refine_airland_combat: "Refine Airland Combat"
 GER_refine_airland_combat_desc: "Airland Battle was the strategic concept that formed the basis of the United States military's combat doctrine in Europe from the early 80s' to the late 90s'. It emphasizes close coordination between land and air forces to pin, outmaneuver, and destroy enemy combat forces, especially ones constricted to the ground. While this concept has been prevalent within the Bundeswehr and the Luftwaffe, it is slowly becoming a less refined concept with equipment gradually phasing out of modernization. Through upgrading equipment, enhancing operational strategies, and incorporating advanced technologies, such as UAS and Cyberwarfare, we can refine our airland battle doctrines."
 GER_modernize_the_leopard: "Modernize the Leopard"
 GER_modernize_the_leopard_desc: "The Leopard 2, a third generation main battle tank, is considered the Bundeswehr's magnum opus. It is considered one of our finest works of engineering, yet, despite these high qualifications, most Leopard 2 models have been left neglected, falling short on technical updates and being completely out-of-date. We should begin refining these models, preparing to modernize the Leopard 2 through enhancing armor, implementing firepower upgrades in the main gun, such as a larger caliber or a more advanced rifled or smoothbore gun, integrating advanced fire control systems, incorporating thermal imaging, laser rangefinders, and ballistic computers for increased accuracy and target acquisition, implementing digital architecture, improving engine and mobility, aswell as improving Active Protection Systems. If the Leopard is the tank of the future, then this must be reflected in its design."
 GER_develop_domestic_capabilities: "Develop Domestic Capabilities"
 GER_develop_domestic_capabilities_desc: "As we rebuild our military capabilities, we should also divert attention to our industry. Factories across our nation lie desolate, neglected, and unkept, with barely any military factories being constructed or retooled. We should revitalize German domestic production, especially in the military, to prepare ourselves for future conflict."
 GER_construct_new_dockyards: "Construct New Dockyards"
 GER_construct_new_dockyards_desc: "Naval dockyards and ports across the German coast are few and far between, and when they are host to a fleet, the port is usually run down, poorly maintenanced and unfit for repairs. We should begin revitalizing dockyards and building a new set, utilizing site selection, feasibility studies, partnerships with private investors, infrastructure investment, using market analysis to tailor the design and capabilities of said dockyards, investing in training programs and education to build a competent workforce, and phased development for essential infrastructure."
 GER_focus_on_trade_interdiction: "Focus on Trade Interdiction"
 GER_focus_on_trade_interdiction_desc: "German Naval Doctrine has long been focused on coastal defense since the Second World War, the days of a Grand Fleet are behind us, sunk along with the Monarchy, but a revival of the Trade Interdiction doctrine of the Kriegsmarine of the 1940's would serve us well, intercepting any enemy convoys, it will be especially useful in keeping Kaliningrad under siege."
 GER_naval_center_of_europe: "Naval Center of Europe"
 GER_naval_center_of_europe_desc: "Germany is the center of Europe's industrial base, it's greatest producer of consumer products, home to some of the world's most renowned weapons manufacturers, but the German naval industry has not shared the same international notoriety for a long time.\n\nNo longer shall our fleet hide beneath the sea, we must focus on high tonnage surface vessels to project not just our own power, but the power of Europe well beyond our own waters, the Kaisers antiquated dream of a grand fleet is not quite dead."
 GER_construct_new_airfields: "Construct New Airfields"
 GER_construct_new_airfields_desc: "As our air force grows to meet new demands, airfields will be necessary to support them, a variety of new non-civil airbases will be constructed in our East to prepare for the coming conflict."
 GER_purge_extremist_soldiers: "Purge Extremist Soldiers"
 GER_purge_extremist_soldiers_desc: "A series of concerning reports have been brought to our attention about far-right extremism within the Heer, Luftwaffe, and Marine. While only a small fraction of our Armed Forces, the number of these extremists has been growing at an alarming rate. We must take immediate action, as extremism within our ranks is strictly forbidden. These soldiers will be disciplined and likely discharged depending on the severity, showing the world that we will not tolerate this behavior."
 GER_turn_a_blind_eye: "Turn a Blind Eye"
 GER_turn_a_blind_eye_desc: "Why should we exempt extremists from the armed forces? Are they not the most dedicated to German defense? No, set the reports aside, a free society should be defended by all of it's citizens, even those with unsavory opinions.\n\nIt may be against doctrine, but we're reforming a lot of things, let this be another one of them."
 GER_upgrade_our_railways: "Upgrade Our Railways"
 GER_upgrade_our_railways_desc: "The rails in East Germany are woefully underdeveloped compared to the West, thanks to Communist mismanagement no doubt, now that we have incentive, we can pass a budget through the Bundestag and get the trains running on time."
 GER_revive_german_military_industry: "Revive German Military Industry"
 GER_revive_german_military_industry_desc: "Heckler & Koch, Haenel, Krupp, Rhinemetall, the list goes on. Germany has world renowned and cutting edge military companies, but we have starved them of a domestic market. No longer, get on the phone and make some new contracts with them, big contracts, they'll expand to meet our needs."
 GER_civil_construction_program: "Civil Construction Program"
 GER_civil_construction_program_desc: "Our civilian industry needs to be propped up, our infrastructure is falling behind, this slump of the past years cannot continue if we're to consider ourselves ready for the coming onslaught.

 GER_pan_european_propoganda: "Pan-European Solidarity"
 GER_pan_european_propoganda_desc: "Europe is stronger unified, for thousands of years it was done by conquest, today it is done by unity and by kinship and by the shared threat of the Russian Bear.

 GER_buy_the_tb2: "Buy the TB2"
 GER_buy_the_tb2_desc: "The Turkish Bayraktar TB2 is a cutting edge military drone produced by one of our allies. The Turkish Armed Forces have collectively been on the forefront of independent military research looking to step away from designs of the East and West and develop their own. Turkish insight is valuable, and putting in a few orders for some TB2 drones will not only bolster and ally, but bolster our striking capabilities and enable our engineers a better look at foreign drone construction."

 GER_expand_wilhelmshaven_refineries_desc: "Our refineries in Wilhelmshaven are some of the few domestic oil supplies we have, and thanks to the civil war in Arabia we are unlikely to be able to import it as we had before, it would be wise to prop these domestic refineries up and expand their operations, we need oil of our own if we are to march to the defense of Europe...or even drive to work."

That is why the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution exists. Extremism, Radicalism, Totalitarianism, must all be stopped at whatever the cost.

 GER_bundestag_help_gui_desc: "The §YBundestag§! is a pivotal feature of Germany's political landscape, giving access to unique focuses and providing various national bonuses. This mechanic revolves around each party's Party Popularity (as represented on the political pie chart), which influences their voting power in the §YBundestag§!. Additionally, each party has a Support Level—ranging across five tiers—reflecting their willingness to back the current government and its legislative agenda.\n\nTo secure §YBundestag§! Support, you must gain the backing of these factions. The higher their Support Level, the more they contribute to the total §YBundestag§! Support based on their Party Popularity. For instance, if a party has §Y20%§! Party Popularity and a Support Level of §Y60%§!, they will add §Y10%§! to the total §YBundestag§! Support.

 germany.1.t: "DEFENDER-Europe 20 Commences"
 germany.1.d: "One of the largest NATO military exercises in decades has kicked off and will run for weeks, with 28,000 total troops from 27 nations taking part. Defender Europe 2020 will include \n\"nearly simultaneous operations across more than 30 training areas\n\" in a dozen countries.\n\nThe multi-faceted, months-long exercise provides the Germany and allies a showcase event for crisis response. The exercise comes amid a backdrop of increased Russian aggression along the Ukranian border and hightened European tensions." 
 germany.1.a: "Semper Paratus"
 germany.2.t: "Turkey Activates Article 13 of NATO"
 germany.2.d: "The old world order continues to show fractures in its' ranks. Today, in what many geopolitical analysists consider a sign of things to come, the Republic of Turkey has given an a notice of denunciation, in turn activating their rights under Article 13 of the North Atlantic Treaty.\n\nThis move has come in the wake of multiple factors. With America's influence collapsing in the wake of its recent election alongside years of NATO curbing Turkish ambitions in the Middle East alongside failure to curb Russian influence in the Black Sea region, the Republic of Turkey has been left with what it considers to be no worthwhile benefit to remaining in the NATO alliance.\n\nThe remaining NATO members have scrambled their diplomats, hoping to make the Turkish leadership reconsider their decision before the alliance loses yet another key geopolitical lynchpin in their ranks - however, hopes are low in being able to carry out these tasks.\n\nThe next few days will decide the fate of Western influence in the region for decades to come."
 germany.2.a: "The Crescent threatens to turn its back."
 germany.3.t: "Turkey Reaffirms NATO Commitments"
 germany.3.d: "Western diplomatic efforts with the Turkish state have found themselves successful. This morning, the Turkish leadership have announced their rescinding of their activation of Article 13, citing that 'the current situation we find ourselves in necessitates strict cooperation between the democratic states of the world.'\n\nNo comment has been received from the Russian and Chinese delegations to the conference in Ankara, though it can be assumed that they are disappointed with the outcome of this diplomatic crisis. Western influence shall remain in the Russian backdoor for the time being - another potential front for them to be worried about in the future.\n\nThough many believe that Turkey is now held back once more from its geopolitical ambitions in the Levant and other regions, many wonder just how many unknown backdoor concessions the West was forced to give to the Republic of Turkey in order to convince it to remain in the seemingly waning military alliance."
 germany.3.a: "The Crescent Stands Firm."

 germany.4.d: "Heavy rains swept across western Germany, hitting the states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia particularly hard. In addition, the neighboring countries of the Netherlands and Belgium were also impacted with heavy flooding.\n\nSmall rivers and streams turned into torrential currents that destroyed entire villages. Dams threatened to break while electricity and cellphone networks were shut down in what became one of the region's worst natural catastrophes in recent generations. Many people died and many more lost their homes and belongings."

 germany.6.t: "The Re-establishment of the DDR"
 germany.6.d: "After over 30 years since the reunification of Germany, it seems that the East has somehow prevailed over the West. Following a series of failures of the Federal Republic of Germany, both foreign and domestic - most notably the loss in Eastern Europe to the Russian Empire - the storming of the Reichstag in Berlin and subsequent declaration of the new German Republic has turned a new chapter in the country's history. The newly ushered in Provisional Government, drawing its legitimacy from the various revolutionary city governments throughout the country have made significant changes to the constitution - including changing the name from the Federal Republic of Germany to the German Democratic Republic, as well as officially stating that the state would be socialist in nature, restoring many elements from the East German constitution.\n\nThis event nearly unthought of 10 years ago, has left a wide array of Germans shocked. While Die Linke has surged in popularity recently, many still stay wary of the dictatorship and hardships that many suffered under the Honecker Government over 30 years prior, wishing to never repeat the mistakes of the past again. Even if a red dawn has risen over Germany, it's future will face many hardships."

 germany.7.d: "After over 30 years since the reunification of Germany, it seems that the East has somehow prevailed over the West. Following a series of failures of the Federal Republic of Germany, both foreign and domestic, voters had ushered in the left coalition of Die Linke, the Greens and the SPD. Although intially remaining a minor faction within the coalition, through careful manouvering, the Anti-Capitalist Bloc of Die Linke has emerged on top. After controlling enough seats in the Bundestag following a snap election, the constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany was officially changed to rename the country to the German Democratic Republic, as well as being officially stated that the state would be Socialist in nature, restoring many elements from the East German Constitution.\n\nThis event, nearly unthought of 10 yeares prior, has left many Germans shocked.

The German public has expressed frustration over the government's perceived inability to counteract Russia's influence on the energy market.\n\nThe anti-Russian protests have attracted a diverse range of participants, including environmentalists, economic experts, and political activists. These groups have united under a shared goal of voicing their concerns regarding Russia's actions and urging the German government to adopt alternative energy sources and reduce the nation's dependence on Russian oil.\n\nIn light of the ongoing protests, it is recommended that the German government consider the following actions:\n\nEngage in diplomatic efforts with Russia to address concerns over the increased oil prices and explore potential avenues for negotiation. Develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to diversify Germany's energy sources, focusing on renewable energy and increasing investment in sustainable technologies.

Signs of \"traitors!\" and \"fascist sellouts\" fly high among protesters. Many hold the belief that the war was not lost on the battlefield, but in the minds of the incompetent commanders who surrendered a war that could have been won if they had continued to fight on for longer. While Germany has sacrificed much during the war, with its citizens suffering through harsh winters without Russian gas, to thousands of German boys dying in Ukraine, the Baltics and Poland to protect Europe from the Russian Fascist Horde, the end of the war made all those sacrifices for naught. While the Bundeswehr High Command ordered thousands of German boys to their deaths in the defense of Warsaw, when asked to put their lives on the line, they quickly capitulated to the Russians. In particular, the concession of recognition of Eastern Europe as Russia's natural sphere of influence and economic reparations have caused widespread anger.\n\nThe group most visible among the protesters is the party Die Linke, who argue that the capitulation was to protect the interests of German \"Finance Capital\" and the war effort was hampered by rampant war profiteering that gave the armed forces sub-par weaponry to cut production costs and maximize production output. Recent polling has shown that confidence in the current government has fallen to the single digits, and it is almost certain that it will fall sooner or later."

While the Bundestag had initially planned to pay off the debts using Russian War Reparations - something that did not come to materialize as NATO forces were forced out of Eastern Europe. With the value of the Euro and German Bonds going into free fall following the Vienna Peace Accords, compounded with the sudden collapse in military production demand, economic shock has crippled. Worse, confidence in the Eurozone is at an all time low - with the region struggling to recalibrate its economy following the loss of the Eastern European markets. With the Frankfurt Stock Exchange dropping 35 percent in a single day - the largest in financial history - Economists predict a period of unprecedented economic catastrophe.\n\nAlready, Hyperinflation has begun to spiral, with the value of the Euro to the Chinese Renminbi, increasing from 7.39 to 13.81 in a single week. At this time - the Deutsche Bundesbank faces an Economist's worst nightmare - a massive budget deficit combined with rampant inflation. No matter the action, the future of Germany looks bleak."

Following the start of the Second American Civil War, the German government had secretly moved to secure the twenty B62 Tactical Nuclear Weapons held in Büchel Air Base. \n\nIn an even worse slap to the face of Global Non-Proliferation is the announcement that Germany will activate its Nuclear Latency. With a surplus of nuclear engineers and possessing the technical abilities to produce an arsenal given its widespread civilian reactors, experts estimate that Germany will be able to have a stable arsenal in 3-6 months. Given Germany's former role as a leader in international non-proliferation, this new policy will likely trigger a nuclear arms race in Europe, with the government of Russia already announcing plans to expand its own arsenal.\n\nAs a revanchist Germany seeks to challenge Russia after their loss in the Russo-NATO war, the nuclearization of Germany and brinkmanship pursued by the German government will likely introduce a nuclear element over any future conflict as policymakers have no doubt that the Germans will not hesitate to pull the nuclear trigger if it came to it."

One Liberal member of parliament for Estonia argued that \"any injustices being experienced by Russians in Estonia pale in comparison to that inflicted on our people by the Russian Imperialists, Soviets, and Putinists.\" A Latvian mayor declared that \"Young men of our nation have a right to enforce our borders and punish collaborators,\" when informed of anti-Russian attacks in his city.\n\nThe most recent attacks on ethnic Russians this last weekend have resulted in eight deaths and over fifty injured, and the problem only seems to be getting worse.

 germany.120.d: "The Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania bore the brunt of Russian aggression throughout the ages and in the recent war. Thousands of young men dead, the countryside scourged and little in the way of gain for these nations materially has led to radicalization among the country's disaffected youth and veterans. This dissatisfaction with the post-war status quo has been blamed on the countries' sizable Russian minorities, and the many new ultranationalist groups formed in the aftermath of the war have begun harassing them.\n\nThe government has largely turned a blind eye toward these recent actions, with many government officials subtly praising them. One Liberal member of parliament for Estonia argued that \"any injustices being experienced by Russians in Estonia pale in comparison to that inflicted on our people by the Russian Imperialists, Soviets, and Putinists.\" A Latvian mayor declared that \"Young men of our nation have a right to enforce our borders and punish collaborators,\" when informed of anti-Russian attacks in his city.\n\nThe most recent attacks on ethnic Russians this last weekend have resulted in eight deaths and over fifty injured, and the problem only seems to be getting worse. Local leaders for the Russian minority in these nations have argued that these acts of discrimination are illogical and go against pluralist principles, they point to ethnic Russian service in the Baltic militaries and refusal to collaborate with Russian forces in many instances as evidence that they are just as good of citizens as their neighbors.\n\nThe Russian minority has called on Berlin to aid them and put pressure on the Baltic governments to end injustices and enforce administering of democratic rights for them."

Initially seen as a bold move toward renewable energy and environmental sustainability, the project now faces serious challenges. Rising electricity costs, growing reliance on imported energy, and the slow rollout of renewable alternatives have all sparked public debate. Critics argue that shutting down nuclear plants has left Germany vulnerable, while environmental advocates remain steadfast, insisting that the long-term benefits of a nuclear-free future outweigh the short-term setbacks. \n\nThe government's position is increasingly precarious. While there is still strong public support for green policies, concerns over energy security and economic strain are mounting. Pressure from the business sector and foreign allies is complicating the issue further, as some call for a temporary halt to the shutdowns to stabilize the grid.

However, accepting the offer might deepen Russia's dependence on European markets, something that has raised concerns among hardliners in the Kremlin who seek a more diversified strategy for the future. \n\nThe proposal comes at a time of tense relations between Russia and the West, and this overture from Berlin is being viewed cautiously. On one hand, the economic benefits are clear: a partnership with Germany could stabilize key industries and mitigate the effects of ongoing sanctions. On the other hand, there is suspicion that Germany is using the opportunity to assert influence over Russian internal affairs and economic policies. Moscow now stands at a crossroads..."

His nomination by the AfD signals the party's desire to present a candidate with intellectual credibility and economic expertise, hoping to broaden their appeal beyond their populist base. However, Otte's previous ties to the CDU and his stance on key issues have stirred debate within the party, with some members questioning whether he truly represents the AfD's core values. \n\nThis endorsement is already causing waves across Germany's political landscape. Otte's candidacy is expected to intensify the polarization within the country, as established political factions on the left and center-right denounce the AfD's decision.

Known for his steady leadership and commitment to European unity, Steinmeier emphasizes the importance of maintaining democratic values and fostering consensus amid increasing domestic and international challenges. His campaign aims to reassure voters that stability is paramount during these turbulent times. \n\nChallenging him is Max Otte, the controversial candidate endorsed by the Alternative for Germany. Otte positions himself as a nationalist voice critical of the current administration, appealing to those frustrated with immigration policies and economic management. Meanwhile, Gerhard Trabert, a physician backed by the Die Linke, focuses on social justice and poverty reduction, advocating for the country's most vulnerable populations. With the election approaching, Germany stands at a crossroads, as the outcome will not only determine its next president but also reflect the deeper ideological divides within the nation - between calls for stability, radical change, and the pursuit of social equity."

He had only been recently promoted from Colonel as part of the Bundeswehrs army expansion plan, but already he wished he'd have turned it down, every general staff meeting just devolves into grimaces, clenched fists, and occasionally yelling, and today was unlikely to be any different as the corporate executives sit in to deliver their reports to the Inspector General, questions are fielded, fists are clenched, General Dorfmueller has long since learned not to even bother, their explanations are always the same, Thyssen-Krupp can't keep up steel production, Siemens is overstressed in maintaining enough staff to service our electronics in a timely manner, Rhinemetall claims they simply cannot build vehicles and weapons at a fast enough pace the readiness plan was shooting for 2025 but our best case scenario projections show adequate readiness as 2028, with our worst case stating our armed forces may be below what we want until 2032, General Dorfmueller has been waiting to receive crucial supplies for his division since his promotion so he can hold exercises and training but artillery cannot operate without shells, Mechanized Infantry cannot train without Mechanized, and his men cannot be allowed to get used to the G3 when he's supposed to be given G36 rifles any day now.\n\nDorfmueller sits quietly in the room as more senior Generals bicker about the readiness plan among themselves and with the executives, his fist clenched under the table so as to hide any signs of ire, his heart burning with sarcastic remarks but his mind drilled to suppress them in his long career."

 germany.228.t: "The Fork in the Road of Life"
 germany.228.d: "Berlin was always a picturesque city for anyone that had the opportunity to either visit or live in. The fascinating historical monuments, the interesting cultural institutions, and the massive variety of cafes and restaurants that dotted every street corner all made the city a favorite destination within the country. A lot of these spots that were frequented by tourists provided some opportunities for Germans to make a simple living. It was not much, but it served its purpose for those who needed it.\n\nWilhelm was one of those people as he was a young cashier in a local café that was frequented by a lot of tourists, especially a lot of Americans and Canadians. But after war broke out in North America, the café never seemed to reach the same level of customers that it always had when all these tourists used to come and visit the city. He now had serious doubts that he could keep his job or even if the café itself could be kept open at this rate. A sense of ever-increasing uneasiness crept into his mind every day as it seemed that the status quo he was so used was now crumbling all around him. The civil war in America, the exploding conflicts across the world, the economic hardships, and the rising tensions in Europe; how long until all of this destroys him?\n\nHe would often think about this on his way to and from work. The diverse scenery served as a great backdrop for a variety of thoughts that troubled his uneasy mind. However, in the last week or so, the scenery seemed to change on every street he passed. Now on his walk to work this morning, he noticed that the streets were now lined with advertisements of all shapes and sizes for the German Bundeswehr. No matter what street he turned on, the vast volume of advertisements was now something Wilhelm could not ignore.\n\nHe finally stopped walking for once and observed one of the massive posters plastered on a street corner. The poster depicted a tall and very handsome looking German soldier saluting the viewer with the text underneath it calling on citizens to fulfill their civic duty to the nation. However, underneath the slogans were a blob of text further promising career advancement opportunities and sign-on bonuses for those interested. These prospects now anchored themselves into his mind, enticing him with a few ideas. Maybe this could be something promising for him, something that could serve as a way out of his troubles with his already shaky job. He wanted to think about this more, but even that seemed like a wasteful prospect to him.\n\nBut as he resumed his walk to work and observed the ring of closed cafes and stores on the adjacent street, he finally reached a simple yet important conclusion,"
 germany.228.a: "Perhaps… this is where I belong."
 germany.229.t: "The Coming Storm from the East"
 germany.229.d: "He had been over these plans a thousand times, but everything was now tormenting him to look it over another thousand. Over and over and over again he looked at the same information to the same effect. Battle plans, newspaper clippings, intelligence reports, estimations, and other predictions from every branch of the German military kept driving him mad. General Wiermann, no matter how hard he tried or prepared, could not escape the inevitable that was written everywhere he looked; the Russians were coming.\n\nHe had seen it everywhere from the TV reports to information he was getting from his own office in the Ministry of Defense. The Russians were preparing for something; he was certain of it. The Donbass, Belarus, the maneuvers in the west, and the exercises in central Asia; it was all pointing to one ominous conclusion. The Russians would soon strike west, and he was afraid that Germany was totally unprepared for it. No matter how many new recruits were inducted, or multinational exercises were conducted, he felt that it all did not matter in the end. All the Americans were gone, their thousands of soldiers and divisions based in Europe were sent home to fight in America; the mighty global superpower had fled Europe to tend to its own demise. Would these countries in NATO's \"eastern flank\" even stand a chance? Would they only be capable of simply buying time for the west? Perhaps these former communist countries of the east would be gleeful for a chance to die fighting the Russians once more but that is not how his countrymen saw it. Is Germany up to this challenge? Would all the preparation and training be worth it? Can Germany survive this onslaught?\n\nThis is what pestered Wiermann every day in his Berlin office. He now just sat and brooded over these terrible revelations to himself with the same mess of reports always cluttering his desk. Today was no different. He just kept reading over the same rehashed conclusions but from newly printed reports sent in the morning. At this point it was almost like a form of madness, but he knew he was not alone in his sentiments. The entire German Army was terrified of what would be soon striking the European continent. This demoralized routine that he had made for himself within the last month or so was the only thing he had energy for these days.\n\nPutting down the latest intelligence report from Russia, he sighed, and began staring at the ceiling. He then muttered under his breath the only thing he could think of at that moment,"
 germany.229.a: "God help Germany, because who else will?"
 germany.230.t: "The Sword and Shield of the Fatherland"
 germany.230.d: "Major Fischer had been preparing for this moment for the last few months. He had been drilling this routine over and over again until the brink of madness. All the training, all the lessons, all the preparation and marshalling of resources would soon display the results that so many were hoping for. Everyone in the armed forces and even all of Germany itself had been up to now consumed by a terrible fear unlike any other. There was fear for the economy, America, Europe, and even the entire world. However, now he could now put his fear aside because he would be taking into full account the fruits of their strenuous preparations. He tightened his uniform and brushed off the dust from his shoulders as he prepared to walk out of the tent he spent the last hour or so preparing in. Inspection day had finally come.\n\nNow stepping out onto a podium overlooking a large open field, he got a great view of the awesome firepower that waited for him. Hundreds of German soldiers neatly packed into rows stood at attention while long columns of Leopard 2A6 tanks and Panzerhaubitze 2000 self-propelled howitzers sat right behind them. They had worked, trained, bled, cried, and sweat countless hours, days, months, and even years to steel themselves for what was to come. They were the best of the best and they knew it. These men were the finest Germany had to offer. Fischer stood at the podium for a few seconds to appreciate the stunning scene in front of him as it filled him with a form of pride only a soldier could understand.\n\nBut pride for the army that Fischer was a part of was not the only thing he felt as he now feel pity and scorn for a hostile army that everyone was suspecting to be going up against very soon; the Russians. How could those impoverished simpletons defeat an army like this? How could Russia challenge a fully readied NATO force let alone the German Army? The Russians were surely either stupid, suicidal, or both. Germany had humiliated the Russians in the First World War, once again in the Second, and everyone seemed very confident that Germany could do it for a third time. Major Fischer, his comrades, and all of Germany knew that they would be ready for this.\n\nNow preparing the microphone, the major began his address to his soldiers.\n\n'Soldiers of the Germany Army! Today is inspection day! Today you will demonstrate to both your colleagues and all of Germany your esteemed prowess as a modern fighting force! Show us what all your training has led up to!' Fischer triumphantly announced.\n\nAll the soldiers in the field, from the ones in the front all the way to the ones in the back, took a deep breath and yelled with a stern ferocity unseen in a long while,"

With the armories of Europe, rabid hatred in our eyes and total disregard for outdated concepts such as ethics and rules of engagement, we inflicted such a deep spiritual wound in the Russian spirit, that they will never dare to crawl back into the light another time.\n\nEurope was beautiful.\nAnd it will be again.\n\nWith our homelands under our steel gaze, we have grasped destiny in our hands.\nAnd we will never let go."
 germany.1111.a: "Nie wieder Kommunismus!"
 germany.2222.t: "The Beating Heart of the Revolution"
 germany.2222.d: "A new world awakes from the sickness that is capitalism, for decades the world was held firm in the grasp of capital and tyranny.\n\nCapital had been weakened in the west as the authoritarians in the east took this to its logical conclusion, invading the people of Europe. In the end, countless lives were lost, all for nothing but to the benefit of imperialists and greedy parasites. Communism was thought to be some crazy idea that finally came to an end 40 years ago. A fever that shook the world, never to return again. They were right.\nThen we awoke.\n\nRed banners were raised in the capitals of Europe, tearing down the icons of capital, purity and order. The time for revolution was yesterday but now is a good time as well. People have claimed that communism died, and has failed, yet did that mean we should give up? Love failed countless times, should we have given up on love?\n\nWith our shackles broken, and our oppressors having received their final punishment, there was an entire realm to the east, eagerly awaiting our liberation. With our hearts filled with fervor and guns in our hands, we marched and marched eastwards, till not a single city was left without the red flag of the international workers raised above the ruins of fascism.\n\nWhat is left, is an unified choir of the liberated people of Eurasia, a tune so beautiful, but it is lacking the voices of America, Asia and Africa. Today we will celebrate our victory, our grand return and mourn the ones we loved and lost.\n\nBut tomorrow, tomorrow the rest of the world will join us in the choir of the liberated.\n\n"
 germany.2222.a: "...a song for all the people."
 germany.3333.t: "History Put to a Halt"
 germany.3333.d: "To say that Europe isn't a continent filled with a rich history would be a blatant lie, but to claim that we had no black pages in our history books would be another blatant lie.\n\nThe end of history, the idea that any notion of extremism would be considered irrelevant and unwanted, Europe was under the calm idea that gentle words and higher ideals would ensure a quiet peace across the world.\nOf course, our rivals in the east disagreed with this peace.\n\nLike a horde they descended upon our allies, our friends and our family, torching all that we held dear until the masquerade of Our Democracy was forced to admit defeat to the Russian menace.\nExtremism is like a toy and at times of great despair, we revert to our childlike selves, wanting to play and to destroy. However, with our bright minds we ensured that the adults remained in charge, free of the shackles of uncertainty, we realized that we were on the right path, we just needed to learn that we have to do more, for Our Democracy, and for peace.\n\nWhen the time was right, when our youth turned into soldiers and when our offices turned into factories, we ensured that we brought forth the innocent flames of liberty to the east, and to torch the heart of tyranny in Moscow.\n\nWith peace once again achieved across the continent, history has once again stopped.\nLike a ship in the storm, we will maintain our course.\nThis isn't change, not even incremental change.\nIt is control. Over ourselves and the world.\n\nThis time forever."
 germany.3333.a: "The cycle stops once again."

 BAY_bavarian_identity_idea: "Bavarian Identity"
 BAY_bavarian_identity_idea_desc: "The Bavarian way of life is what is often thought to be entirely German, whereas typical elements such as the traditional Lederhosen and Dirndl attire, idyllic mountain scenery with alpenhorn blowers and beer in one litre mugs is originally mostly Bavarian. \n\nBavaria's inhabitants are said to be charming, proud, self-confident, and usually sociable but sometimes stubborn. Grumbling is just part and parcel of everyday life. However, though maybe complaining about one's own problems in life, Bavarians adopt a liberal motto of ''to live and let live'' \n\nGermany's former head of state, Roman Herzog, once famously called Bavaria the land of ''laptops and lederhosen'' and while laptops might not symbolize the top-notch technological achievements of our days anymore, the underlying logic stills holds true: Bavaria is a region that values where it comes from but openly embraces the future at the same time."
