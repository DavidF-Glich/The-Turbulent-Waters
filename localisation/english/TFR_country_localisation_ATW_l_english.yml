 ATW_its_only_begun: "It's Only Begun"
 ATW_its_only_begun_desc: "For years, our cause has struggled under the jackboot of Judeo-Bolshevik repression and complacent \"whites\" willing to betray their racial salvation for monetary gain and power, slaughtering heroes of the Aryan race with their greedy, slimy, backstabbing hands. Now, the beginning of the end has come. When our Great March is done with, the unrelenting and unforgiving wrath of the Aryan people will spare none. This is just the beginning."
 ATW_reopen_the_ratlines: "Re-Open the Ratlines"
 ATW_reopen_the_ratlines_desc: "As the war against global degeneracy wages on in Florida, fighters from across the world are taking up arms to fight the parasites where it matters most. Hundreds of foreign volunteers from across the globe have arrived to fill the gaps in our frontlines, bringing additional training and information aswell. If our great march is to persist, then ratlines must be opened in every corner of the globe to aid our struggle, as the Foreign Legions aided our German counterparts 80 years ago."
 ATW_friends_abroad: "Friends Abroad"
 ATW_friends_abroad_desc: "With the re-opening of ratlines across the world, now comes the time for the development of further contacts with our global counterparts. Underground cells and organizations doing their part to resist degeneracy and institutions repressing the White race are to be integrated into the greater struggle, aiding in the arrival of Foreign Legions through the ratlines. Organizations such as the Feuerkrieg Division in Europe, The Base in Cascadia, Combat 18 in the United Kingdom and the Russian Imperial Movement come to mind, all leading the charge against Bolshevism."
 ATW_operation_sleeping_beauty: "Operation: §YSleeping Beauty§!"
 ATW_operation_sleeping_beauty_desc: "Our division has never truly been centralized, and that is by design. The lone-wolf terror attacks that we perpetuate have come to help us greatly in resisting the vile rot that plagues white society, and that sentiment is greater now than ever as we have brought the fight to a solidified frontline. Our comrades have succeeded in establishing behind the line cells, known as the Werwolf, and now they will be called into action. Terrorizing civilian and military infrastructure deep into enemy territory, the decadent structure that promotes vile complacency will be knocked down, and those who benefit from it will know true fear and despair."
 ATW_the_flames_of_change: "The Flames of Change"
 ATW_the_flames_of_change_desc: "With the seeping of Judeo-Bolshevism into every crevice and corner of American \"society\", a degenerate corrosion aiming to desecrate every proud Aryan both inside and outside of America, any fragile hope of cutting the root of this issue through conventional means has been dashed long, long ago. Already, the winds of change flow freely through the air; glorious victories both on the homefront and abroad have spurred a new calling for Aryans to take up arms against the parasitic vermin and reclaim their homeland from those who pillage it. Only through fire and brimstone alone, can the white race be saved."
 ATW_operation_orange_fuzz: "Operation: §YOrange Fuzz§!"
 ATW_operation_orange_fuzz_desc: "With glorious victory over the degenerate rot that is the National Guard, and the descending of the Antichrist on our southeastern flank, now is the time to lure both of them into the same trap and suffocate them. The final push northwards against the Loyalist traitors who seek to continue the slaughter of the Aryan people has begun, and as they fall so will the wicked Blue Helmets who aid and abet global Juda. They will pay for rearing their heads against the righteous crusaders, and they will do so dearly!"
 ATW_the_antichrists_screams: "The Antichrist's Screams"
 ATW_the_antichrists_screams_desc: "After a valiant struggle against the forces of the vile Blue Helmets, the righteous Aryans have emerged from the ashes of the degenerate city of Miami victorious. Yet, the city remains just that: a spectacle of the degenerate plague consuming the white race, riddled with elements subverting the Aryan revolution. If we are to reach the final victory, then the source of the Floridian rot must be thoroughly cleansed by any means necessary."
 ATW_operation_speedball: "Operation: §YSpeedball§!"
 ATW_operation_speedball_desc: "The collapse of order across Florida has resulted in both positive and negative outcomes for our righteous conquest, one such side-effect being the vile cartels and gangs besieging our northeastern frontier. Certain cells within the Division have been able to infiltrate the hispanic plague laying waste to our crusade with relative ease, and we have been able to use these connections to our advantage. Despite this, they continue to aid the Judeo-Bolsheviks and divert attention from the Tampa Bay area. This will go on no longer, and we have concluded that they will be easy pickings for our warriors."

 ATW_broadcast_our_terror: "Broadcast Our Terror"
 ATW_broadcast_our_terror_desc: "With the callous slaughter of hundreds of urban degenerates riddling our great Aryan nation, it is clear that the Jewish rot goes far beyond the State of Florida. Whites complacent with the subversion of their race by external forces must be made aware of the brutality necessary to cure white society from the inferior races that plague it. Florida will become a never-ending snuff film, one that will be broadcasted to the entire country."
 ATW_ransack_the_armories: "Ransack The Armories"
 ATW_ransack_the_armories_desc: "While our Aryan crusaders have proved themselves to be extremely capable on the battlefield, showing tremendous physical strength and extensive knowledge of their weaponry, said weapons are few and far inbetween. Our soldiers have been outfitted with whatever they could find through scavenging and pillaging, with most of them being unreliable and logistical standardization being non-existant. This has created a number of problems for our men at the front-lines, preventing us from breaking out of key urban areas leading into northern Florida. As such, a major shift in policy must take place, beginning the homogenization of front-line equipment through ransacking armories and military bases once utilized by the degenerate Jews to police and massacre our people. With their own weaponry, our warriors will continue to march on, rifle in hand."
 ATW_accelerate_the_collapse: "Accelerate the Collapse"
 ATW_accelerate_the_collapse_desc: "Despite after so long, after so many triumphs and victories, the Jewish degeneracy that so many subjugated whites had been called to defend still persists in the State of Florida. If the fate of our Division is martyrdom, then the only way to make the world truly fear the Aryan might is to inflict as much destruction as possible. No home, no factory, no store, no school and no library will go unburnt in our flame of hatred. Accelerating the collapse of the World Order of Zion will only baptize our potential successors, and our front line shock troops must know this; to that end, they will give it their all to make sure no soul collaborating with the degenerates will be left alive."
 ATW_domestic_small_arms_production: "Domestic Production"
 ATW_domestic_small_arms_production_desc: "Since the takeover of Southern Florida, the industrial capability of the region has been completely and utterly destroyed. Workers have left in droves, and those who stayed only wish to survive our slaughter and nothing more. While true to the ideals of SIEGE, this has been detrimental to our war effort; auxiliaries, special forces operators, and front-line infantrymen alike have been bled completely dry of equipment over the course of the great siege. Significant force must be utilized to begin starting up domestic arms production, and by the toil of üntermenschen shall a new Aryan nation, baptized in these armament sweatshops, be born."

 ATW_an_army_purification: "An Army of Purification"
 ATW_an_army_purification_desc: "We have done it. The Atomwaffen Division, our glorious Aryan knights, are victorious over the Judeo-Bolshevik plotters in Florida who have so vigorously defiled every aspect of white society. Whites who have remained complacent with those who subjugate them will be dealt with just as we dealt with the Jews themselves, and, instead of acting with desperate ruthlessness and barbarity, we will act as purifiers and the ultimate salvation of the Aryan people now that the rot and their collaborators have been removed."
 ATW_an_army_chaos: "An Army of Chaos"
 ATW_an_army_chaos_desc: "With our triumphe over the Jewish menace in Florida, the true extent of their plots have been fully exposed, and they run deeper than one could ever imagine. In every single corner of global society, they rear their ugly heads to continue their vile system of subjugation on scales thought impossible. Their vicious plague runs so deep within our society that the only way to fully rid the Aryan race of the rot and bring true salvation is to amputate it entirely, even if it means revising our National Socialist beliefs and foregoing politics. For the Aryans, it is clear that their destiny lies in destruction of every crevice exposed to the Jewish World Order, and that purification is simply impossible at this point in time."
 ATW_rattelsnakes_and_alligators: "Rattlesnakes and Alligators"
 ATW_rattelsnakes_and_alligators_desc: "Now that Florida has been fully liberated from the slimy hands of the Jew, our attention must be diverted northwards to prepare for an invasion of the South. A cesspool of degeneracy, ranging from greedy neo-confederates who pretend to preach the ideals of the white race, while in reality are being used by Judeo-Bolsheviks to split the white race, to black separatists who seem to have forgotten their place. Florida was just the beginning, and it's time for the next rotten structure to come crashing down."
 ATW_georgia_on_our_mind: "Georgia on our Mind"
 ATW_georgia_on_our_mind_desc: "Florida is subdued, none within dare stand against us,thus, our spirits look north, to another oppressed satrapy of the Jewnited States of America: Georgia. The state possesses many modern industrial works, as well as the city of Atlanta, a valuable asset despite its corruption at the hands of blacks and their Jewish overlords. If any resist, we shall scourge the state as Sherman would never."
 ATW_the_greatest_sin: "The Greatest Sin"
 ATW_the_greatest_sin_desc: "We sons of Essau, disciples of Cain, we wanderers, we accursed, have long thought of bowing before the Nazarene or other Jews to have but a moment of peace. And we spurn that notion betimes! All who succumb to the guile of weakness must be excised in a hail of bullets! We must be like unto the Spartans, of whom it was said that if a man came home from his defeated legion, he was a brigand!"

In the very same graveyards where warriors lie, beside them rest priests, negroes, and other filth. These buildings have become resented by all honest men, and as such, removing the shielding hand of the state will doubtless lead to these cankers being ripped out, though no doubt not without a healthy effusion of blood."

They must have no religion beyond the basest superstition, for anything more shall undoubtedly become a vehicle for their advancement. They must not be allowed access to technology beyond basic work tools.

Consumerist temples will be torn down, and in their place new hearts, arenas, and theaters where death and life mix freely. and no more shall squalid, soulless architecture be permitted.

 ATW_break_the_southern_spirit: "Break the Southern Spirit"
 ATW_break_the_southern_spirit_desc: "Yankee America built an Empire from iron and blood, brought forth by the whoop and holler of the most concentrated, corrupted Nazarenes. At the point of their rifles fell the Aryan nobility of the South, and ever since the region has been dominated by its most degenerate elements. In concord with negroes and Jews they have surrendered their birthright in pursuit of the Kingdom of Jesus. The past must be redeemed.

Wars upon wars, needless bloodshed staining the soil of Europe and America, all over the peculiarities of the ramblings of Desert peoples. It is no surprise, then, that there has been a turning away from Christianity as the seams of Western society come apart, yet, strangely, many still cling to this archaic religion. They must be enlightened. We shall broadcast incessantly the falsities of their holy book, illuminate the nonexistence of Christ, and elucidate the perversions of Paul. Christianity must be discredited, its pallor illuminated for all to see."

It has no patience for the parliamentarian process, nor does it seek to implement a petty dictatorship. It is explicitly racial, where others \"see no color\". True National Socialists are moral, but not pharisaic. They are willing to use violence, but equally as willing to peacefully interact with their fellow Aryans.

Within our territory, all leftists who forswear their allegiance to world Jewry may find a place in a Party modeled off of the People's Temple; this new Rural People's party shall be our left hand."
 ATW_expose_the_collaboration: "Expose the Collaboration"
 ATW_expose_the_collaboration_desc: "Capitalism and Communism are two sides of the same Shekel. Wall Street funded the Bolsheviks. Karl Marx was in contact with Winston Churchill's father, praising the British Government's undermining of Imperial Russia. Yet, many of our people are increasingly absorbed in the grand battle between these two ideas. Our propaganda must be informative about the connection of Capitalist thinkers and Communist ones, and in our propaganda we must never present the two as distinct."

While he was ostensibly a Marxist, in reality his goal was nothing short of the establishment of a Khmer Imperium, a sort of Southeast Asian Reich. He was against mechanical-rational idealogy, evidenced by his clearing of cities, and purged his country of racial aliens, which ultimately spurred the Vietnamese invasion. Many parallels can be drawn between him and us, and we can learn a great deal from the Khmer Rouge's experience."

 ATW_heralds_of_the_apocalypse_dynamic_desc: "The vanguard of the Aryan Crusade is, and always will be, the soldier. Perfectly fit and trained, they are to act as a lone-wolf militant fighting for the cause, even if he is besieged on all fronts by his enemies. Of course, they are the ones who brought the Atomwaffen Division to where it is today, international or local, auxilliary or front-line fighter.\n\nWhile all of this may be true, the crux of the issue lies in their weaponry. While most of the Division is trained well, due to the pool of dissatisfied veterans from both the Army, Police and National Guard filling Atomwaffen's ranks, their guns and equipment are usually subpar at best, if they even have any. Most firearms originate from Black Market dealings, unreliable improvised shotguns, confiscated hunting rifles and even 3-D Printed Models, making a living nightmare for any poor logistician working for them. The inconsistency and unreliablity of their gear have proven fatal for the Division's progress, and it should be dealt with as soon as possible."
 ATW_industrial_anarchy_dynamic: "Industrial Anarchy"
 ATW_industrial_anarchy_dynamic_desc: "Ever since the Atomwaffen Division seized control of southern Florida near the beginning of the Second American Civil War, one of the most devastating effects of the Siege Ideology and the \"Doctrine of Destruction\" is the brain drain that came with it. The havoc spurred by the Division's ruthless massacres in places such as Fort Myers would give little hope to Floridian workers that they would be adequately treated by the nazi warlords. As such, those who didn't leave initially are now abandoned in urban slums patrolled by \"Aryan\" auxilliaries, giving them no choice but to find shelter and forage for food instead of working. This has been remedied by small slave labor encampments, barely making enough for the Division to reach as far as the Tampa Bay, though it is not nearly sufficient."
 ATW_doctrine_of_destruction_dynamic: "Doctrine of Destruction"
 ATW_doctrine_of_destruction_dynamic_desc: "The \"Doctrine of Destruction\" is the root of the Atomwaffen Division's policies in \"governing\" territories. It is heavily advocated for by the Division's Bible, \"SIEGE\", and is one of the many things that separates it from organizations such as the National Socialist Movement. To inflict as much chaos and damage on the Judeo-Bolshevik manifestations within American society; to the point where the whole world will stand upon a pile of ashes so the White Race can rise up and reclaim their rightful position over those who threaten it. This includes everyone opposing the Division's ideals, and especially whites who they see as \"collaborators\". This dashes any small hope of public support, even from those who they acknowledge as allies, like the National Socialist Movement of Michigan, or the Patriot Front."

Destruction is an art form that requires careful precision, a ship that must sail a permanent storm, and for that we need to know where to hit hearts and minds, and when.\n\nTo say that the Atomwaffen division is in itself divided among different beliefs would be an understatement, from nihilists to satanists, from Christians to anarchists and it requires a strong will to keep those that lurk in the dark on the right path. We know how to enrage our people, how to calm them down, how to soothe them and how to entice them to bring forth carnage, with whispers in their ears and symbols of power we'll push through the enemy.\n\nRevolutions are not a tool of liberation, but a tool of punishment."

With America crushed under our stampede of chaos, we have managed to secure the final part of our goal. Nuclear weapons, the great equalizer, the tool that turns both the weak and the strong to ashes.\n\nWe have the neck of the world in our hands, and we will snap it.Of course, we do not intend to just die alongside our hatred, we have to make proper preparations, stockpile supplies, build up shelters so our people can thrive after the end and raise defenses.\n\nIt's inevitable that the world will stop in its tracks once they realize what we are planning to do, and like a final death rattle of an old man, it will try to stop us by any means necessary. We can't stop now, we can't lose now, for that will make all our efforts be in vain.  Prepare yourself, for this is our final test before our great liberation.\n\nThe reaper is well known to us and we do not fear him.\n\nTry to keep your §YSuspicion§! as low as possible. If it reaches above §R40%§!, our neigboring enemies will form a coalition against us, and will declare war on us. If it reaches above §R60%§!, a domestic revolt will rise against us!

We've prepared for this, years of training and stockpiling have led up to this, the American empire is falling apart and we'll make sure it falls even harder, not out of mercy, but out of malice.\n\nWe can not afford defeat, for that will mean the end of our race all together. A cornered beast may make weird jumps, and the more we get pushed to desperation, the more we become like a bright flame that becomes harder and harder to extinguish. Be wary, no matter the intensity of the flame, burnout will soon follow and in the long run we will suffer more than they will.\n\nWe are the surgeons, and America is our subject, know where to cut and do not get pushed into a corner.[ATW_level_of_mechanic_text]"

This monumental task involves a sweeping cultural overhaul to align society with our principles. We must focus on integrating and reshaping our new populations, guiding them through a process of indoctrination to embrace our regime as their true savior. Subsequently, we face the challenge of addressing and re-educating those who remain resistant to our vision, ensuring they are either brought into alignment with our ideals or removed to prevent any threats to our authority. \n\nThe path ahead is undeniably filled with difficulties, yet our past achievements demonstrate our formidable will and strength.

Atomwaffen Division, the vanguard of the true future, stands ready to bring about the great cleansing. Our nuclear arsenal is in place, and our bunkers - hidden deep underground - are stocked, fortified, and ready to shelter us through the coming apocalypse.\n\nThe so-called leaders of the world are blind, thinking their regimes, economies, and armies can continue without consequence. They cling to power as their civilizations decay. But today, we shall rip that power from their hands. The fires of nuclear destruction will purify the Earth, wiping away the corrupt systems, leaving nothing but ash. And from the safety of our underground sanctuaries, we will survive. The weak will perish, and when the surface is free of their rotting influence, we will rise.\n\nEvery detail is set: major cities, military installations, and industrial centers across the globe will be wiped out in minutes. Our bunkers, deep beneath the Earth's surface, will shelter us as the world above burns. There is no turning back now. We press the button, and the Final Dawn begins.\n\nThe time has come to launch.

 atom.1.desc: "Somewhere within the Great Plains, where massive expanses of grass and farmland used to occupy, now disconnected by the commonly found destroyed military convoy, or the downed Apache, was a relatively small plot of land, cleared perfectly of the tall grass that used to be there. A couple of sandbags, a crudely made helicopter landing pad, and an entrance that led downwards to an underground facility were all that the plot of land had above ground.\n\nUnderground, however, was a completely different story.\n\nThe facility underground penetrated deep downward into the ground, multiple living quarters, command centers, and other rooms inhabited said facility. The facility overall was perfectly designed to be self-sufficient, relying only on the outside world for air and that was it. Truly, it was a beautiful piece of artwork for the engineers who worked on it. It was now [ATW.GetLeader] who inspected the mastercraft that was the recently constructed bunker. He had commanded that these bunkers be built across the nation, he had inspected some already before, but this one by far was the best. He looked around and gazed at the beauty of the main living quarters he had entered, paintings were hung on the walls, plants were ontop of tables, and coaches were placed about. The only issue he had was the inspection crew he usually brought along with him, in which they were making obnoxiously loud noises while bickering behind him.\n\n\"Why don't we just get it over with now? Just bomb them now and let 'em burn.\" His ears perked at the suggestion one of the men had said, not thinking ahead. He turned around quickly, snapping at those he brought along with him for the insepection.\n\n\"All of you quiet!\"\n\nThey looked in silence at the man, he had clearly had enough of their chatter. He walked over to the young man who had suggested the idea, he looked at him in the eyes, only a short distance away from him. He spoke with a gravel and low tone."

The libertarians, emboldened by our unyielding rule and the suffering it brings, have risen in rebellion against the us. Fueled by their misguided ideology of freedom and individualism, they challenge our power, seeking to dismantle the very foundations of [ROOT.GetNameDef].\n\nThese rebels, who falsely claim to fight for the rights of the people, do not understand the world they inhabit. They fail to see that their chaotic philosophy only serves to weaken the strong and sow discord among the righteous. They preach liberation, but their actions threaten to destabilize everything we have fought to build. The fires of their insurrection rage against our ideals, and we will not allow their rebellion to succeed.\n\nAs the streets are filled with their protests and clashes erupt between our loyalists and the libertarian forces, we must respond with absolute force. Our enemies must learn that any attempt to oppose our righteous rule will be met with unyielding brutality.\n\nThe time has come to make an example of these traitors. We will quash this rebellion with overwhelming force, demonstrating that the only path is that of obedience. The fires of rebellion shall be extinguished, and the ashes of their insurrection will serve as a reminder to all who dare defy [ROOT.GetNameDef]." #AI :_(

While the so-called \"legitimate\" factions scramble to preserve their crumbling order, we innovate. We adapt. When they bring tanks and planes, we bring the raw power of destruction, built with our own hands.\n\nOur resources may be limited, but our will is limitless. From the wreckage of this shattered land, our engineers have forged something truly terrifying - The Killdozer Brigade. Pieced together from scavenged construction equipment, military wreckage, and raw steel plates, these massive vehicles are slow but unstoppable. They carry the weight of our rage, reinforced with thick armor, bristling with repurposed weaponry. Their purpose is simple: smash through enemy lines, annihilate fortified positions, and leave nothing but destruction in their wake.\n\nThe first prototypes have rolled off the assembly lines - if you can call them that - and soon they will be ready for the battlefield. These beasts will be the spearhead of our assault, breaking through the urban strongholds and fortifications that stand in our way. The Killdozers are not merely machines; they are symbols of our inevitable triumph over the weak.\n\nOur enemies think they are prepared. They are not.

This absurd theater has gone on long enough. The wise among us have learned to appreciate a truer view.\"\n\n\"Christianity is the primary instrument used by ZOG to lie to and control our people. It is a Jewish religion, no one disputes this. It emerged from a desert, and was spread among slaves and merchants; the exact kind of people who have made America what it is!

We are seizing our destiny by the throat.\"\n\n\"We seek the stars, we bask in their illumination. Our Lucifer is out there, the ethereal driver of Aryan progress.

Thousands ring out in joy as celebrations commence in the wake of our victory, our government hard at work planning ahead for the future, our soldiers drinking to no end as they celebrate in their own way, the dead congratulate us from the grave as their sacrifice has not been in vain. All of it is a testimony to our triumph, to our cause.\n\nBut sadly, all is not perfect. While we have accomplished our seemingly final objective, many more have appeared in its shadow. The new lands we have conquered are filled with insurgents and agents of chaos, hellbent on annihilating our regime. The infrastructure of the new lands is everything but obliterated, years of war have taken its obvious toll on these structures, and more years will be needed to return them to what they once were. That is, should it be needed. The nations of the world have also reacted to our success, and the aftermath has left us alone diplomatically, but nothing much has changed there.\n\nThe new finish line has been set, and a new race has begun.

 atom.7.d: "Kommandant Frank Zimmermann stood before the bonfire, watching priceless art and literature burn as the bitter air bit at his cheek. He was above all a man of orders, he followed the instructions of his superiors to the letter. This had made him a very good soldier, but today he wondered if it made him a good man. The orders he had been given today were very simple. \"Eliminate all degenerate art and monuments to the old order.\" These too, he had followed perfectly. Nearly every piece of evidence that the old government had even existed in D.C had been or was to be systematically taken and destroyed by him and his men. All of it cast into the fire before him. It was his job as the leader of his unit to ensure nothing was looted or saved by any soldiers who somehow had managed to see value in the degenerate art he had been tasked to destroy. It was then that two soldiers brought forth a portrait of George Washington. The painting was quite large, so the men seemingly had given up on carrying it and were dragging it through the dirt and mud, uncaring to any damage they might be causing to the priceless painting. For a moment Frank thought to himself that it was a shame that such a beloved and culturally significant piece of artwork was to be destroyed so callously. He kept these thoughts secret of course. Expressing them would no doubt get him put before a firing squad, his years of unflinching loyalty made meaningless. It wasn't too much of a pity though, after the war there would undoubtedly be many more paintings made just like it. These ones crafted by Aryan hands, uncorrupted by Jewish and modernist influences, and made in the image of figures who stood for strength and aryan values, rather than for liberalism and degeneracy. His thinking was interrupted when the soldiers approached him. \"This one also, Kommandant?\". He didn't have to think about his answer now. \"Throw it in\". He peered into the eyes of the general, and watched as they quickly melted into an unrecognizable goop of oil paint. As the painting burned he smiled to himself, knowing that the order they built would not be destroyed as easily."

Once it did, the decoder within the group quickly worked his magic, deciphering the text. Upon his completion, and with a smile he turned around to face Mason and his group.\n\n\"Gentlemen. Upon this day, the last remnants of the Atomwaffen Division's enemies in Florida have officially been wiped out.\"\n\nThe room almost immediately exploded in celebration as the collection of staff indulged in their victory, even a champagne bottle was brought and promptly popped just for this occasion.\n\nAs the party began to unfold in full swing, Russell, who was enjoying the victory just as much as everyone else, noticed Mason. The past figurehead of the group, turned leader, was sitting in his chair almost like nothing special had happened. But there was another thing that was strange about it. It took Russell a couple of seconds to figure it out, but when he did his eyes almost shot open wide in realization. \n\nHe was smiling. \n\nMason wasn't usually the person to smile or laugh like the others, in fact, Russell couldn't recall the last time he had seen Mason smiling. He walked over to Mason and sat down beside him.\n\"You're smiling.\" he said with a hint of shock. Mason turned to him and sighed before answering, \"It's a special occasion.\" Russell chuckled a bit before speaking again.\n\n\"Then why aren't you celebrating like the rest of us?\"\n\nMason gazed across the unfolding party, thinking out his next words, knowing that they would be one of the most important things Russell had heard from him.

Out of the ~400 foreign volunteers who had signed up through the group's Telegram, only about 150 were present here, with all kinds of different backgrounds; Feuerkrieg Division, Combat-18, Blue Awakening, veterans associated with scattered Active Club groups, even members of the Azov Battalion and Rusich Group were present. One such volunteer was Vikentiy Abalyshev, an initiate within the infamous Russian Imperial Movement.\n\nAs the general of the Foreign Legion, Craig Lang steps forward to begin the briefing, Vikentiy couldn't help but be reminded of the language barrier that divided him from his comrades. He knew barely any English, only enough to get himself a position within the group and arrive in the war torn country, courtesy of the connections he had built in the region. Currently, however, there were no such connections to guide him linguistically, no online translators, nothing but himself and the little knowledge he had. Lang begins to outline the details of the mission with precision and clarity that went unnoticed by none.\n\nYet, for Abalyshev, Craig's words are little more than a blur - a pitch of foreign syllables that were beyond his comprehension, leaving him feeling confused and utterly humiliated. He desperately tried to follow along, leaving him feeling isolated and out of place. Regret and shame began to take hold; how did he have the audacity to sign up and be shipped off to Florida when he barely understood the language that was being spoken, one that he had learned to hate?\n\nAs the briefing ended, the other fighters that stood next to him gave a Roman salute, and began to chant. One such phrase he was able to recognize, a synchronized \"HEIL!\", stood out, as he gave one himself. Being noticeably weak and quieter, silence befell the training grounds as Lang stepped forward towards him. Craig glared at him, with Vikentiy glaring back, Craig now demanding the Russian to honor the oath he had taken and to show respect to senior commanders.\n\nFor a fleeting moment, Vikentiy began to forget his place. He wanted to lash out at the filth in front of him, who dared to speak in such a degenerate language and demand authority. These thoughts were quickly drained from his mind as he remembered why he was there, and the code of honor he shared with his fellow man. He was silent as he collected himself, before throwing a Roman salute and yelling;"

Before them, a small gathering of prisoners sat tied to their chairs, their expressions weary yet attentive. These men varied by experience and age, some being lifelong National Guardsmen who have dedicated their lives to the state they owe so much to, others being enlistees as young as 19 who barely knew how to handle a rifle with care. Some, mostly the youngins, were naïve enough to think that they would be shown some form of mercy; that they wouldn't be tortured for hours on end only to be disposed of like their colleagues.\n\nFools, they were.\n\nAs the men were blindfolded and relentlessly beaten by their captors, clad in stolen gear and skull masks, the door leading into the room was opened, its light illuminating the feculent space allowing the prisoners to see their surroundings more clearly now.

He would not be the only man to die that night, with each successive footstep spelling certain death for the next prisoner in the line of chairs.

This, however, went over horribly with the other National Front diplomats, who immediately notified their governments of the situation. Once notified, the diplomats were told to try to save the situation by overturning the decision, but this was to no avail. Once their efforts failed, they resorted to desperate measures by kicking us out of not only the National Conference by majority vote but also the National Front itself. This caused the dissolution of the National Conference, as the delegates rightfully criticized the move, ensuring that the attempts of power by the two main power players, the National Socialist Movement and Patriot Front, were never to see the light of day. \n\nNow, however, as the situation's shockwaves have truly set in, we've been getting reports of troop movements along our borders, as the National Front prepares for either themselves or us to make the first move."

Some were just too stubborn to believe that America could one day fall from glory, collapsing into its own rot... Now, belief in the Tribe-run Empire had been dashed; warfare the likes of which the world had never seen before raged on across the detritus of America, shaking the system to its core. The Atomwaffen Division had gone from a small, relatively unknown terrorist group to an organization striking fear in the hearts of vermin the nation over. All the while, one question continued to persist in the minds of the heroic commanders making up the Division.\n\nWhere was James Mason?\n\nWhile some heard of his flight from Denver, they hadn't the slightest clue where he would be heading. Nothing but radio silence greeted Mason's eager acolytes. Mason, however, had been planning a momentous return, one that would solidify the Atomwaffen Division as a force to be reckoned with, one that would go on to destroy the last vestiges of American degeneracy before moving onto the rest of the globe. That was if they hadn't died trying.\n\nReturn was all Mason could think about while in his Phoenix motel room, slumped over  his sofa. He had heard the incessant pleas of his comrades in Florida; how they were struggling against the Judaic onslaught with little ammunition or material, how they were under attack on all sides by both degenerate gangs and government forces alike. He certainly admired their fortitude and willpower, two elements that would lead to their ultimate victory in Tampa Bay. Most across the country - or what's left of it - would never imagine that they would push farther than Fort Myers, let alone the third-largest city in the State.\n\nYet Mason? He always knew that they would be victorious. He grabbed his television remote, turned on the TV, and watched the news. Tampa, the Atomwaffen Division... That was all they could talk about. He felt the fear in the newscaster's eyes as he watched the footage of the city burning and the people suffering, smiling to himself as he saw the final vision of the project that he had worked so hard to achieve.

It has become more obvious that some rounds of centralization are required. The first step to this involves appointing our first official Head of Government. Enter James Mason, the one who was currently deciding on who he would appoint to the position. The Head of Government would hold massive amounts of power, however, they would still be second in command, making sure that Mason could quickly put them in their place if they decided to act out of their own goals, instead of the Division itself.\n\nHis first option was the ever-loyal Brandon Russell, who had been with Mason since before the war and had proven his loyalty time and time again. Despite his adherence to the original ideals of the Division, Accelerationism, and Annihilation, which didn't fully align with Mason's views, Russell's experience and dedicated followers made him a strong candidate. Mason also believed he could influence Russell's ideas with some persuasion, making him even more enticing.\nThe second option was Jordan Jereb. A recent recruit, Jereb quickly made an impact by drawing in recruits and mainstreaming the Division. His previous leadership experience with a militia group and Christian identity helped him integrate well and were the reasons why the Atomwaffen Division had spiked in manpower before the war. His ideals were more compatible with Mason's, though his loyalty might be less certain given the fact he has had to go through less. Nonetheless, he would also be a good pick.\nThe third option was Joshua Sutter, the enigmatic leader of the Satanist faction within the Division. Known for his mysterious nature and the cause of the faction's rapid rise through his many subversive and underhand tactics, Sutter had not formally claimed leadership, citing it would distract from his duties. His loyalty and ideals were unclear, but his faction's contributions and methods had made him an intriguing, though risky, choice for Mason.\n\nMason's option would be monumental, and the impact of his decision could most likely anger the other options. But as one would say, no risk, no reward. And so finally, Mason made his decision."

The former Atomwaffen figurehead, and mastermind of the organization, James Mason, has reportedly arrived on Floridian soil, and taken control of the Division once again. This comes as a surprise, as before the Civil War broke out, James Mason was found missing inside his home during an FBI raid. It was later pronounced that he was killed during infighting inside the Atomwaffen Division, however, it has become clear now that those reports were made up as videos and pictures show Mason perfectly healthy, posing with Atomwaffen soldiers.\n\nThe earliest report of his arrival was earlier this week, when a video emerged showing him driving down the streets of Fort Myers, waving to ecstatic Atomwaffen soldiers. The trend continued as more and more videos emerged of Mason traveling within Atomwaffen territory as if he were a celebrity. The news officially culminated into its climax as a video was released from the Atomwaffen Division. The video showed two people, Mason and Brandon Russell inside a room, presumably one of the various temporary headquarters near the front, where Brandon declared that Mason would become the new head of the Division by the end of the day. \n\nWhether the Atomwaffen Division will be able to defeat its enemies in Florida is still unlikely, however, the battle of Tampa has shown that, although weak, the Atomwaffen Division still has teeth.

With the history of animal rights in Nazi Germany (and therefore dictating or at least inspiring the place of animal rights in our political doctrine) contradicting current logistical realities in Tampa, much discourse has opened about what to do, with two schools of thought opening up: One arguing that the entire park should be demolished and recycled for scrap, any remaining staff to be executed and the animals be put down and buried. Proponents argue that this is the only option that would not allow ZOG fighters to set up a base of operations in the hectic warzone of Florida and which would be beneficial at all to the war effort, as metal could prove valuable for armaments.\n\nThe second school of thought appeals more to the views of Adolf Hitler, declaring that the predators of BCR are much like the white man.

Looking to make the time go by faster, one of the soldiers sparked some small talk with his friend.\n\n\"You know I heard that we're marching out soon, supposed to be engaging some town that didn't surrender.\"\n\n\"You know I'm starting to get tired of slaughtering innocent civilians. Like sure they should've surrendered once they were given the chance, but like I don't get the thought process behind killing everyone there. Just doesn't make sense to me,' the soldier responded.\n\"You're not alone there, man. Personally, I don't like the fact that we've got a Satanist as our company leader.\"\n\n\"Oh god, I hate those guys. The fact they even have any power in the government is still shocking to me. Like giving power to the Christians or Accelerationists I can understand. But giving it to a group whose ideals are just 'kill everything' is idiotic.\"\n\n\"I say we try and get the company leader to resign or get fired,\" one soldier said.\n\n\"That would be tough, but if you've got a plan I wouldn't mind joining you.\"\n\nAs the conversation continued, the squad of soldiers discussed the plan. In the end, they decided that once they got more people on board, they would refuse to take any more orders from the company leader until he resigned. They all knew that it would be near impossible, but they were confident that with enough people on their side, they could make the impossible possible again."

However, the stark reality of the economic collapse and the ensuing chaos in America forced him down a far darker path. His aspirations were shattered, and driven by the crushing burden of his family's debts, he found himself joining MS-13, a choice made out of desperation rather than desire. The gang's world was brutal and unforgiving, a stark contrast to the noble service he had once envisioned. Now, the consequences of those choices were painfully clear. Botero was in the clutches of Atomwaffen soldiers, their grip on his arms unyielding. The masked figures loomed menacingly around him, their cold eyes devoid of sympathy. One of the soldiers, with a tone that hinted at casual cruelty, posed the question, \"What should we do with him?\" The other soldier's indifferent shrug only added to the sense of foreboding.\n\nMoments later, a grim idea was suggested, and with it, Botero found himself facing an entire squad of Atomwaffen soldiers. His heart raced as he was placed at gunpoint, the threat of death hanging heavy in the air. The soldiers, finding a perverse pleasure in his suffering, handed him a pair of bongos. The cruel game was simple: he was to play the drums for as long as he could endure, or face the dire consequences of their wrath. With no choice but to comply, Botero began to play. As the night wore on and the hours dragged into the early morning, the physical toll became excruciatingly clear. His arms, already weary, began to buckle under the strain. His hands, battered and bruised, bled and throbbed as the relentless drumming continued. Each beat brought fresh waves of pain, and the once simple rhythm became an agonizing trial.\n\nEventually, exhaustion overcame him. His arms, now near immobile and covered in bloodied bruises, fell heavily on the bongos. He looked down, his vision blurred by tears and pain, and closed his eyes in a resignation that spoke volumes. The rhythmic thud of the bongos ceased, and with it, a profound silence fell over the grim spectacle."

Ever since then, she hasn't heard much of what was going on outside of said town. The few days after the occupation when the forces of the Division were still battling on the outskirts of the town, and nobody had come to disconnect the town's connection to the internet, were the only days the internet was still available. After that period had ended, and outside connection was impossible, Leeah spent most of her days inside her home, playing with toys and looking out the window as the town square that was once so full, now lay empty, only the occasional leaves or scavenger animals filling the void. Safe to say, her life was mainly dull going forward.\n\nThat would all change one day when she looked out the window like she usually would, and instead of seeing the usually empty town square, she saw a collection of a few masked men, presumably the men her mother had warned her to avoid if she ever saw them. The group had set up a pentagram in the town center and was seemingly just standing around from what Leeah saw. Until they started to move, splitting into three groups, picking up their rifles, and marching toward the nearest apartment buildings. One of which was Leeah's building.\n\nIn the next few moments, Leeah found herself hiding inside her closet as cries of terror and screams of pleading filled the entirety of the apartment. She dared not to leave the closet, or even open her eyes until the noise finally died down, where she then scrambled out of the closet and crawled towards her window. Looking out she saw not only the original collection of men but also a new group, most of which being from her apartment. The one person from the group she almost immediately recognized, and the one nearest to the pentagram was her former pastor, Mr. Popper. She watched in horror as he was shoved to the middle of the pentagram and stabbed repeatedly, collapsing with an empty look in his eyes as the blood from his wounds leaked onto the concrete."

They may think that their armies, airforces, and navies are strong, but they will be all but slaughtered once they truly engage our forces.

The ARA declared that such a government poses an intolerable threat to global peace and stability and, as such, cannot be permitted to continue its rule. Within moments of this declaration, the situation escalated dramatically, as heavy shelling and coordinated attacks erupted along the entire border of the NSOA, marking the start of a significant military offensive against the regime. Reports indicate that these initial assaults were quickly followed by strategic missile strikes and sabotage located deep within NSOA territory, targeting key military installations, infrastructure, and logistical hubs in an apparent effort to debilitate the regime's ability to defend itself or launch counterattacks.\n\nThe NSOA has responded strongly to the recent announcement, issuing a fierce declaration that what they perceive as a \"war of extermination\" has been waged against all people of Aryan descent. In their statement, the NSOA has painted this as an existential threat, emphasizing that Aryans are under direct attack from a coalition of exterminators. As a result, the organization has called upon every individual of genetic Aryan heritage to rise up, take up arms, and engage in what they term the \"Aryan Liberation War.\" They urge their followers to mobilize, uniting in armed resistance to defend what they see as the survival of their race against perceived oppression and aggression from external powers."

That was until one soldier came across the corpse of an Atomwaffen soldier.\n\n\"Aw goddamn, that's disgusting.\" He said with his nose pinched. The corpse in question had a gaping hole in its skull. The soldier yelled out to one of his friends and asked if he could help him move it off of the road. The soldier happily obliged, but as the two tried to pick up the corpse, a small beeping could be heard from within the skull. In the next few moments, the corpse exploded, sending shrapnel into the two soldiers, and ripping off both hands of the one who had his hands on the corpse's shoulder.\n\nThe Humvee that was with the squad almost immediately detonated as well once a rocket came straight through the windshield. The rest of the formation was left in disarray, fighting for their lives as they shot wildly into the street in front of them. The engagement lasted not much longer as an unknown marksman picked off every remaining soldier. When the last Floridian soldier fell, the marksman peeked his head over the scope of the SVD he was using, and picked up the radio next to him, radioing into who was on the other side."

 atom.101.desc: "\"God has unleashed upon the corpus of these fallen, disunited States, the full tempest of his rage. As he did unto Sodom, Gomorrah, Babylon, Assyria, and of course wayward Israel, he has declared with trumpets and cannons the beginning of a tribulation. The blood of the sinner must flow, he must be given over to his worst instincts; desires; lust. He must be taught, by seeing all of the false idols he loved smashed before him, to love God. The hounds of hell bay at our borders, the light of Christ blinds them yet. They know that what they have done in darkness, all of their crimes and abominations, will be brought forth into the brightness of day.\n\nChrist offered mankind the olive branch of peace, yet his righteous vengeance may also flow whenever he so wishes. Such is the case now. What man hath wrought, God shall destroy. What the profane pretenders to the title of Israelite culminate, shall be vindicated. The goals of the prideful have already been upended; In due time they shall be forgotten. As we are his Church in godly times, we are his scythe in times of judgment.\n\nJust as Constantine fought under the cross and was victorious, just as the ancient Aryans bore aloft the sigils of their One God, just as the Israelites, the true Israelites, fought with the Ark of the Covenant upon their shoulders, we too shall bear aloft a symbol; the symbol feared an loathed and despised by the \"good people\" of the system. Atomic fire is both our symbol and our ultimatum. By the light of our muzzles, or by the God-given radiance of an Atomic blast all shall be known, and all of the doings of the system shall pass away."

Judeo-Bolshevik subversion… smatterings of propaganda and news, hardly distinguishable even in the best of times, came through FInally after some exertions, a single, clear voice began to fill John's tent.\n\n\"...Whereupon, God saw fit to judge these people, and yea, he adjudged them and found them unworthy. Their iniquities were great and they were given over unto their deepest desires. Great cities of filth and squalor they erected, great masses of mixed flesh and abominations of soul, mind and body. God appointed that his people, purified by toil in the Pharaoh's service, would come upon these dissipated people and sweep them from their midst.\"\nThe crowlike muttering of James Mason sounded through the tent. It was silent on the outside, John, if he had cared to listen, would have noticed that his neighbors' tents were too tuned in to hear Mason's words, his voice resounding through the camp like a maddening audio distortion.\n\"God has appointed us like unto the Israelites, he has declared us the representatives of his will. It is we who will tear down their Jerichos and erect our Jerusalems!\"\nThunderous applause, John fiddled with the audio, quickly turning it back up.\n\"Long have the Aryan peoples toiled for the Jewish Pharaohs. Too long! We will throw them from their thrones, yea, like unto the Amalekites we shall take their children and wives, their land and all they possess, and cast them into the earth, whereupon they shall cry out and blaspheme, and be no more. By the muzzle of our rifles we shall tear down their abominations and erect a Godly, pure nation!\"\n\nThe radio went silent, then A bizarre mixture of Horst Wessell Lied and a hymn played. John sat in silence for a moment, before switching the radio off, and called outside his tent. He stared, a few miles away their lines had come, and if they kept their pace up, they would be upon him once again. He sighed. He no longer wanted to run."

He claims to be the original Cain from ancient times, cursed by God and eternally condemned to wander the Earth. Now, he has taken an interest in the Order of Nine Angles. His knowledge of forbidden sciences and tactical prowess are unmatched, and his insights into the nature of destruction and power are both seductive and terrifying. His presence could galvanize the Atomwaffen Division, but it comes at a risk: Kane's allegiances are unclear, and his vision of the world is nothing short of apocalyptic."

He looked in silence as Sutter pulled a wooden chair from the far corner of the cell, right in front of where Mason sat. Sutter sat down in the chair and merely looked at Mason.\n\nIt took Mason a few moments before he spoke up. \"I'm assuming that you're the one who orchestrated this?\" Sutter looked at Mason a few more moments, his eyes dotting across his face a couple of times, \"You'd assume correctly.\"\n\nMason chuckled, bringing his tied hands up in order to scratch an itch on his face, \"Then I'm assuming you're here to kill me.\"Sutter smiled and pulled something out of his back pocket. Adjusting to the barely lit cell, Mason figured out what it was.\n\n\"Is that a Lu-\" Mason couldn't finish his sentence before he was interrupted \"A Luger yes. Chambered in 9x19mm Parabellum. It's yours actually... well, was yours. Now it's mine.\" He said smiling, \"And yes. I am going to kill you with it. But I'd like to talk to you before I do so.\"\n\nMason squinted at Sutter, \"Talk to me?\" Sutter merely nodded, a wide grin upon his face.\n\n\"Okay…what do you want to talk ab - \"\nA loud gunshot rang out and bounced across the walls of the cell. Mason slumped over as life drained from his neck and all over the floor.
