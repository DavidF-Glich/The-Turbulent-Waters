TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_generic: "Thank you for playing through the full content for one of our nations! While of course the massive amount of work in this mod is thanks to our team, none of that would have happened without you: the people who supported us through the creation of this gigantic endeavor. Those who made high-quality shitposts, chipped in here and there, left comments on developer diaries, and became part of this great community.\n\nPlease visit our social media sites on the links attached in the opening GUI, which can be opened with the question mark button in the top right corner.\n\nAlso, keep your eye out for new content."
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_PRC_Xi_Good_End: "In [GetYear], the chapter of history has finally turned over. China, a great civilization that once struggled in the wind and rain and explored in the rise, now stands at the starting point of a new era. After countless difficult choices and struggles, the new era is waving.\n\nThe future is full of challenges and hope. China's road is still long, and the new journey has just begun. But this time, it is no longer a pursuer, but a real leader - a strong man who makes his own voice on the world stage.\n\nEven though the remnants of the old era did everything they could to laugh at this era, now, the new era has completely shocked everyone with his roar - every remnant of the old days who is lucky enough to exist in the new world.\n\nThank you for playing China! Thank you for playing this mod!"

TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Chep_Success: "The winds of progress sweep across the United States. From New York to San Francisco, from San Antonio to Juneau, America's cities stand full of life and vitality. Their people bustle along well-paved roads and go to work at shining factories and offices. They enjoy leisure and travel great distances, ready to see where the road takes them. In these ways, Philip Hart and Chep Morrison leave America a transformed nation, better for their leadership.\n\nOf course, not every challenge has been defeated. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and human suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated, not permanently, but the torch of liberty seems to burn brighter than ever against the dark horizon. America stands ready for the challenges ahead."
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Bad_End: "The United States of America, once at the top of the world, has lost its former glory. Over the past few decades, we have gradually lost our advantage in the Cold War against China. Economic recession, political polarization, and social unrest have made everyone on this land feel unprecedented despair.\n\nThe technological advantage that once led the world has now been almost wiped out by China; the world's most powerful military force can only barely support itself in the crisis today; the economic engine that once drove the world is now struggling in the recession and is no longer alive. The cracks in society are getting deeper and deeper, as severe class division and the public's dissatisfaction piling up. Our allies and partners have lost confidence in us and are gradually drifting away.\n\nIn this land that once led the world, flames are rising and the Stars and Stripes are waving in the wind and rain. It is very likely that after losing its hegemonic position, the United States will fall into the long river of history and become a bleak memory.\n\nGood night, America.\n\nThank you for playing America! Thank you for playing this mod!"
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Schlafly: "Who are we? What are we doing? What have we done to each other? As tensions rise and arguments spill out onto the streets, many Americans are consumed by these questions. They no longer recognize their neighbors. They no longer recognize their country. They no longer recognize themselves. All is bile, anger, and frustration. Phyllis Schlafly, for better or worse, has exposed the rot at the center of the American system.\n\nOf course, this state of affairs raises questions for the decade to come. War looms on the horizon. Bigotry thrives. Pain and suffering dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently and, in America at least, the fires grow and the threats seem stronger than ever. Whether this house divided against itself can stand or whether it will collapse onto its foundations is yet another question that will have to go unanswered until this radical new Administration finishes its term."
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Yock_and_Hall_Torture: "This country is broken. It is obvious in the haunted faces of every person in the street, in every dilapidated storefront and burnt-out church. People have lost faith in their neighbors, their communities, and their government. They have lost faith in America and the ideals upon which the Republic was founded. Soon, perhaps sooner than many expect, there will be a great reckoning. Each citizen will need to confront their sins.\n\nOf course, America's collapsing institutions will not stop the crises to come. Indeed, it's likely to worsen it. Wars will spread. Bigotry will endure. Pain and suffering will be meted out upon the innocent and guilty alike. With the torch of liberty extinguished, monsters of all kinds creep their way toward the world stage. What happens next, and what violent delights they inflict, remains a mystery—for now."
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_USA_Generic: "All of America holds its breath. After the chaos and uncertainty of the 1960s, the country seems to be entering a new age with a new set of developments. New technologies, capable of tremendous good and evil, appear. A new slate of leaders begins to accept their commands. A new generation enters the voting booths for the first time.\n\nOf course, there will be more challenges to come. War remains. Bigotry remains. Pain and suffering still dot the globe. None of these monsters can be defeated permanently but so long as the torch of liberty can burn against the dark horizon, America might endure."

TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_PRK_Nothing_Ending: "[GetYear], North Korea remains under the §A Iron Curtain§!, frozen in time. The §Y Kim regime§! stands firm, life caught between §Y propaganda§! and §A harsh reality§!.\n\nSkyscrapers loom cold, fields lie silent. Labor and loyalty reign. Under §A nuclear shadows§!, the nation stands isolated.\n\nThe world moves forward, but here, nothing changes. Slogans remain §R red as blood§!, the system grinds on, history stands still.\n\n§1Yet, is something stirring beneath the silence?§!\n\nThank you for playing North Korea! Thank you for playing The Turbulent Waters!"
