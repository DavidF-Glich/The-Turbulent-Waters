Isolated, she is forced to witness what global carnage does to the environment, carrying the burden that no-one will listen to because it harms their political agenda or legitimacy... \n\nThe End of the World"

 Iceland.5.t: "Mammoth brought back from Extiction"
 Iceland.5.d: "In a groundbreaking achievement that could reshape the field of genetics and conservation, a team of scientists in Iceland have announced the successful resurrection of the woolly mammoth, a species that went extinct over 4,000 years ago. \n\nLed by a collaborative effort between geneticists, paleontologists, and conservationists, the project aimed to utilize cutting-edge gene editing techniques to recreate the extinct species. The team extracted DNA fragments from well-preserved mammoth remains found in the permafrost of Siberia. These fragments were then carefully sequenced and compared to the DNA of their closest living relatives, modern-day elephants. \n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, the team achieved their breakthrough with a healthy female calf named ''Lyra,'' who was born in the team's specially designed facility in Iceland. Lyra, the first woolly mammoth to walk the Earth in millennia, is being hailed as a testament to human innovation and determination."

 Iceland.7.d: "In a weird twist of fate, Colossal Biosciences has announced that they had been able to revive the extinct Raphus Cucullatus, otherwise known as the Dodo. However, mere moments after it hatched out of its egg, it fell to the floor, dying immediately. \n\nThis both a victory, and a loss for the crew at the Colossal Biosciences Lab in Reykjavík"
