 USB_secure_the_capital: "Secure The Capital"
 USB_secure_the_capital_desc: "In what may be the most tragic event of our nation's history, the unthinkable has become reality. For the first time in 150 years, the American continent has been set alight, with brother against brother once more as fighting has begun between our legitimate government and the pretender to our west. While virtually everyone had wished that things would have been different, we cannot afford to falter in the face of this threat to our long democratic tradition. If we are to weather the storm before us, we must first secure our nation's sacred capital; ensuring that Washington D.C is safe from all immediate and possible threats, allowing our interim government to operate unhindered in this dark time."
 USB_fighting_for_democracy: "Fighting For Democracy"
 USB_fighting_for_democracy_desc: "With the government split into two, our newly-restructured Union government has been fortunate enough to maintain the loyalty of many of America's top military leaders, in addition to a sizable portion of the federal army. While this is undoubtedly a great advantage in our desire to rescue our nation's democracy from peril, it has come with its fair share of issues - namely, much of the army's rank and file have been uncooperative out of personal politics, causing disorganization and disloyalty among the troops. In addition, the issue of army structuring and doctrinal debate has sprung up amongst the general staff as well as congress, primarily regarding whether the conventional approach or alternative formations will be more effective in this unprecedented period. These questions will have to eventually be answered, preferably sooner rather than later if we are to ever proclaim victory against the traitors in Denver and elsewhere."
 USB_protect_the_collective: "Protect The Collective"
 USB_protect_the_collective_desc: "In order to protect the individuals within society, we must protect it is as a whole which can be done through the lense of collectivism."
 USB_protect_both: "Protect Both"
 USB_protect_both_desc: "In order to protect both the collective and the individual, we must protect both of them equally."
 USB_protect_the_individual: "Protect The Individual"
 USB_protect_the_individual_desc: "In order to protect everyone, we must start at the lowest level of society, the individual."
 USB_emergency_presidential_powers: "Grant Emergency Presidential Powers"
 USB_emergency_presidential_powers_desc: "Our nation's constitution, while undoubtedly highly important in regards to defining the social and political rights of our citizens, has taken precedent over necessary procedure far too often. In some cases, this largely outdated document has actually hindered not only the democratic process, but the ability of the president to adequately respond in times of crisis, such as the period in which we have found ourselves currently in. This glaring problem must be corrected, effective immediately. While some will decry this move as authoritarian, we can no longer allow an age-old document to take priority over the safety and wellbeing of our nation's citizens; thus, the sitting President will be given the emergency executive powers necessary to weather any and all storms awaiting our Union and its citizens."
 USB_maintain_constitutionalism: "Maintain Constitutionalism"
 USB_maintain_constitutionalism_desc: "When our forefathers envisioned this great Republic, there was nothing more important to its foundations than our great Constitution. Written and designed by the brightest minds in all of this nation's history, it endows all Americans with unshakeable rights in which few nations can truly claim to uphold. While some modernists have claimed that this sacred document of ours has grown outdated and fickle in the wake of this national tragedy, we know better than such shortsighted thinking. While our functioning of law and government have undoubtedly been tainted as a result of this civil war, we cannot afford to watch our hallowed legal and political traditions falter, regardless of the circumstance. The Constitution was made to stand the test of time, and it will stand untampered."
 USB_well_organized_militia: "Well Organized Militia"
 USB_well_organized_militia_desc: "While our military doctrines have historically been focused on conventional warfare combined with overwhelming support, our current situation has led to something of a re-evaluation of our tactics. With active, mass-scale conflict having broken out on American soil for the first time in over a century, we have found ourselves with a need for both manpower and suitable doctrine in order to adapt to our situation. As such, we will be taking inspiration from the Founding Fathers - restructuring ourselves to a more militia-oriented force, as our forebearers once did in their own struggle for tyranny 300 years ago."
 USB_trust_in_the_high_command: "Trust In The High Command"
 USB_trust_in_the_high_command_desc: "As we have retained a vast portion of the federal army, we have likewise retained the doctrinal mindset of past wars, albeit on a significantly larger scale than we have faced in recent history. With this advantage of a conventional, modern army against our opponents, we need only to reaffirm these doctrinal notions of ours to better suit fighting on American soil. However, we must first and foremost reorganize our armies as soon as possible - restructuring and securing the loyalty of the uncooperative and disruptive lower ranks, lest they turn tail to Denver."
 USB_crack_down_on_insurgents: "Crack Down On Insurgents"
 USB_crack_down_on_insurgents_desc: "Ever since the Civil War began, insurgents in places such as West Virginia and Kentucky have done serious damage in our efforts at liberating America from the traitorous Republicans. Immediate action, such as the formation of specialized counter-insurgent brigades, preventing nascent opposition from taking root in local populations and using brute force to crush guerilla pockets must be taken. If we are to liberate America and save our democracy, then we shall deliver justice to behind-the-lines opportunists striking us in the back."
 USB_negotiate_with_progressives: "Negotiate With Progressives"
 USB_negotiate_with_progressives_desc: "The Progressive caucus in the Democratic Party has grown considerably in recent years, thanks to the increased involvement of the younger generation in the nation's politics and a growing discontent towards the neoliberal policies of old. While many establishment politicians consider their proposed ideas to be unrealistic at best and radical at worst, their commitment to driving down wealth inequality and championing for social justice are admirable ones overall. With their newfound influence as a result of the conflict, it is in our best interest to negotiate with them - both to keep them in the party line, and to avoid alienating them and their supporters in this tough time. Perhaps a more progressive outlook is just what we need to gain some popular support?"
 USB_deals_with_liberals: "Deals With the Establishment"
 USB_deals_with_liberals_desc: "The Liberal caucus in the Democratic Party is, as expected, the primary caucus within the party itself, making up the majority of establishment politicians within the Democratic Party. Adherents to the long-enjoyed Washington Economic Consensus, their commitment to moderate policies regarding matters of a mixed economy, and their staunch commitment to the principles of freedom and equality have been a staple of D.C politics for quite some time now.\n\nWith the breakout of war on American soil, it is pivotal that we begin making deals with them in order to maintain party unity and appeal to their supporters across the Union. It would serve us well to be able to pass some much-needed and long-awaited legislation. Only good things can come from pleasing our base, especially now."
 USB_consolidate_the_conservatives: "Form the National Unity Coalition"
 USB_consolidate_the_conservatives_desc: "The Grand Old Party, while largely having shown their true colors by fleeing to the traitor in Denver, has not entirely gone down the route of treason. In D.C, a sizeable portion of moderate Republicans and conservatives have made the wise choice of remaining with the Union. Due to their predicament, they have grown considerably less hostile to opposing legislation, having seemingly opened themselves up to cooperation in the name of preserving the legitimate government in congress. While many may baulk at the notion of making any sort of effort to appease or otherwise make gestures to what is left of the Republican Party, we cannot allow the ones who have remained with us to be left in the dark. By making some overtures to the conservatives, we will help ensure that they remain loyal to us, as well as giving the more conservative portions of the population a reassurance that their voices are heard - so long as those voices remain loyal to our government. Maybe it would be wise to take a more conservative outlook if it means less opposition from the more right-wing elements among the populace."
 USB_revisionism: "Constituional Revisionism"
 USB_revisionism_desc: "The Constitution of the United States, albeit a brilliant document in many aspects, is not without some glaring faults of its own. While the Founding Fathers no doubt held future generations in mind when writing it, they were entirely unable to predict just what kind of world we would be living in some 250 years in the future. Despite its importance, we cannot afford to maintain its more outdated principles any further, especially in a time where some of those age-old principles may have led us to this very situation. Even though such a move will face much opposition, we will make strides to revise and modernize the more untimely elements of the Constitution and its adherents, lest it leads to even further issues in the future."
 USB_minor_reparations_for_minorities: "Support Minority Businesses"
 USB_minor_reparations_for_minorities_desc: "The notion of financial reparations has gained some traction in recent years, with a growing movement focusing on historical and systemic woes inflicted upon minority groups that have yet to be truly corrected. Especially today, the descendants of enslaved African-Americans in this country are at a drastic economic disadvantage across the board, primarily due to historical instances of both blatant and subtle oppression against them. With most opposition to this program collapsed or open to compromise, perhaps now would be a good time to take the first steps in carrying out this long-overdue measure in the form of officially subidizing all minority owned businesses. Not only will this help ease the structural inequalities that many minority entrepeneurs face, but also stimulate our economy in a time of war."
 USB_fund_farming: "Reinstate SALT"
 USB_fund_farming_desc: "In the wake of the nation's collapse, few matters have become as pressing as our agricultural supply chain. With a lack of a viable market and most of the nation's most pivotal agricultural regions, there is a massive food crisis occurring across the Union, something horribly akin to a famine of the likes never before experienced on American soil. In order to mitigate this dire situation, we must immediately roll out subsidies to farmers across our territory, so we can keep them afloat and revitalize our food production in the face of this conflict."
 USB_regulate_corporations: "Regulate Corporations"
 USB_regulate_corporations_desc: "Although we enjoy and appreciate the backing of many prominent corporations and acknowledge their important role in the Union's economy, we cannot simply allow them to do whatever they want. Even before the war, these businesses were often under-scrutinized for their misdeeds, be it maintaining poor working conditions, environmental pollution, or other law violations they have historically gotten away with. Despite their economic viability, they must be subject to a number of new and updated regulations and restraints, in order to ensure that a sensible amount of government oversight is upheld as they continue their operations across the Union. They may grumble at this measure, but they will simply have to make the necessary adjustments. Perhaps now they'll be more mindful of their activities, without their long-enjoyed degree of impunity."
 USB_financial_diplomacy: "Financial Diplomacy"
 USB_financial_diplomacy_desc: "The Union, thanks to our legitimacy in the holding of congress and much of the federal seating of government, has attained the cooperation and trust of many wealthy conglomerates and companies, several of whom were beneficial donors to the Democratic campaign. Their assistance was greatly appreciated, and they have remained quite cooperative for the time being, allowing our government to function a bit smoother in the face of our now-collapsed economy. With the arrival of this conflict, however, these corporations have increased considerably in influence, both among the political and state apparatus. If our government is to maintain control of itself (of which being, not at the beck and call of business interests), we will have to outline the method in which we will deal with them. While many in congress believe that cooperation with them is the best and sensible solution, both out of a desire to reap the benefits for the Union and to maintain past business-friendly relations, many others have floated the somewhat radical prospect of doing away with the traditional corporacratic relationship of which we have followed for quite some time now, both in an effort to curb their influence in American politics as well as their influence within the economy. Regardless of the way we wish to deal with corporate interests, we will eventually have to make a decision."
 USB_increase_corporate_taxes: "Increase Corporate Taxes"
 USB_increase_corporate_taxes_desc: "The issue of taxation among the country's largest and most wealthy businesses has always been a bit of a taboo topic within establishment circles. Although it had been generally agreed that these corporations could handle the increased payments, their repeated contributions and donations towards our campaign efforts generally came with quite a few catches and deals to be fulfilled while in office, leaving us with little means to alter that status quo. With our current predicament, we see little reason not to go forward with these alterations in revenue; taxes will be increased on our corporations, allowing us to attain some much-needed funding in addition to ensuring that they start paying their fair share in our society from now on. After all, they should be more than capable of affording some additional payments."
 USB_revitalize_the_consumer_market: "Revitalize The Consumer Market"
 USB_revitalize_the_consumer_market_desc: "With the Union's economy in complete disarray, so has the majority of the traditional product and resource consumption of old. Many people have begun resorting to the bartering of goods, with many people having found themselves unable to regularly spend money on consumer goods as they had done before. Naturally, it is crucial to the stabilisation of our economy that we reignite this aspect. By allocating various subsidies to a number of the most well-known and financially viable companies responsible for producing these goods, we can breathe new life into this market area - encouraging people to once again spend money and fuel the traditional supply and demand circuit, aiding our economy and helping return a decent sense of normalcy in the lives of our citizens."
 USB_revisit_the_education_system: "Revisit the Education System"
 USB_revisit_the_education_system_desc: "Since the days of the first civil war, Affirmative Action had been used in a number of areas to swiftly accelerate social progress for long-marginalized and surpressed groups. Now with the country in the midst of a new bloodier domestic conflict, it is time we call upon the legacy of Lincoln to once again move the tide of history to one of equity and fairness. In order to give various minority groups a much-needed leg-up in our historically discriminatory society, a number of inclusive policies will be implemented in order to assist these groups in areas where they are woefully underrepresented."
 USB_revise_the_civil_rights_act: "Pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act"
 USB_revise_the_civil_rights_act_desc: "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a landmark piece of legislation for its time, considered by many to be a triumph against racism and other forms of discrimination. While a very noteworthy and useful step forward for equal rights in America, the events of recent years and the increased awareness of systemic inequality have brought to light some notable shortcomings of the original law. With this in mind, we will begin an effort to revise and update the Civil Rights Act, adding in some much-needed expansions in its protections of minority groups. This will not only better suit the conditions of targeted groups in modern times, but will open the door to further reforms in the near future as well."
 USB_pass_the_equality_act: "Pass The Equality Act"
 USB_pass_the_equality_act_desc: "The Equality Act is considered by many to be the most comprehensive and expansive civil rights act to date - something that, up until now, we have never truly had an opportunity to pass. As an  amendment to it's precursor legislation in the Civil Rights Act, a variety of groundbreaking (and frankly overdue) provisions include not only an expansion of already-existing minority protections, but a variety of federal protections regarding those of certain sexual orientations and gender identities - expanding these protections to members of the LGBTQ+ community. In addition, the Act will specify and expand the protections against discriminatory treatment in a number of areas, ranging from public services, employment, and other programs. With the influence we hold in congress, we will waste no time in righting the wrongs of yesterday. As a front for unity, freedom, and democracy, let us finally take this great step forward."
 USB_revitalize_the_affordable_care_act: "Revitalize The Affordable Care Act"
 USB_revitalize_the_affordable_care_act_desc: "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, whereas remaining the most prominent overhaul to our nation's healthcare coverage system in decades, has been shown to be woefully inadequate in the face of the war's effects on the populace. With more and more people undergoing physical and psychological harm each day as a result of the fighting, overtures must be made to existing healthcare coverage if we are able to adequately address the health needs of our populace in the face of a collapsed economy and nation. We must adapt if we are ever able to ensure that no American will be left destitute as a result of their sustained injuries, either during or after this war's conclusion."
 USB_pass_the_PRO_act: "Pass the PRO Act"
 USB_pass_the_PRO_act_desc: "The Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, is a law that would amend the National Labor Relations Act, for the purpose of expanding "various labor protections related to employees' rights to organize and collectively bargain in the workplace". It would prevent employers from counteracting labor organization, and would strengthen the right of employees to join a union. This bill should be passed as soon as possible to win over the trust and support of the working class within our territories, and begin a new era for American capitalism, one that protects the rights of the worker."
 USB_call_a_special_hearing: "Meet with the Corporations"
 USB_call_a_special_hearing_desc: "It's never been a secret that the many conglomerates within our economy hold significant political influence, and have played a significant role in shaping our civilian economy to keep the torch of freedom alight, even while it's besieged on all fronts. Despite their help, several issues have arose both socially and economically as a result; an outburst of public support for unions, the blocking of many pieces of important legislation, an increase in congressional lobbying and most importantly the issue of the war economy. We must organize a catch-all meeting with the executives of the most influential corporations within our borders to resolve these issues."
 USB_emergency_factory_retooling: "Emergency Factory Retooling"
 USB_emergency_factory_retooling_desc: "Across our territory, dozens of factories left derelict after years of neglect continue to hallow both our civilian and war economies. To begin the revitalization of the war machine and civilian industry, we must begin the retooling and redevelopment of abandoned armaments factories, mills, power plants, refineries, coal breakers, and steel mills, reinvigorating economic output and bringing in thousands of new jobs."
 USB_blow_the_whistle: "Blow the Whistle"
 USB_blow_the_whistle_desc: "America has forever had a love/hate relationship with corporations. While corporations like Standard Oil and U.S. Steel helped jumpstart industrialization, they have been the source of climate destruction and worker exploitation. While we have always advocated for the death of these entities, it is time that we put our words into action. We will seek nothing less than the total end of corporate influence over America, and we will stop at nothing to ensure that this happens. While this is sure to anger conservatives within our government, we will gain major favor amongst liberals and progressives in our government and broader citizenry."
 USB_force_corporate_compliance: "Force Corporate Compliance"
 USB_force_corporate_compliance_desc: "Despite their significant contributions to our efforts in building back better, the many corporations operating within our borders have seen to have forgotten their place. Already, dozens of reports have been brought to our attention detailing corporations violating federal code, especially in the treatment of workers. Corporate discontent with recent legislation has also been clear, and it may spark a wave of corporate dissension and outright ignoring the word of law. This has no place in American society, and we must intervene to ensure corporate compliance."
 USB_tighten_our_grip_on_the_plutocrats: "Tighten our Grip on the Plutocrats"
 USB_tighten_our_grip_on_the_plutocrats_desc: "The only two things true in life are death and taxes. While the one percent of society have historically been the least affected by taxes, they have also found ways to get out of paying their share. Whether it be through "generous" donations to charity, unrealized capital gains, or IRAs they have been finding new ways to skirt by paying what they owe. We will tolerate this no longer, and we will force the rich to pay what they owe us either by law or by force. The cost of war is high, and if the elite are not willing to play their part, then we will force them too. "
 USB_zero_unemployment_initiative: "Zero Unemployment Initiative"
 USB_zero_unemployment_initiative_desc: "Unemployment has been a stain on both our civilian and war economies. It adversely affects the disposable income of families, erodes purchasing power, diminishes morale, and reduces our overall output in both sectors of the economy, which has resulted in disaster. We must take as much action as necessary to smash unemployment and bring millions of new jobs into the American economy, or else we face total economic collapse in these trying times."
 USB_provide_economic_incentives: "Provide Economic Incentives"
 USB_provide_economic_incentives_desc: "Amidst these times of troubles, we have been facing extreme economic hallowness in every sector of the economy. It has been crippling our war effort and the home front, beginning to drain federal funding and reducing economic output, spurring financial disaster. This has been caused by both unemployment and a lack of financial incentives. We must provide incentives such as subsidies, bonuses and an increase in salaries to begin revitalizing the war and civilian economies, increasing output and strengthening morale."
 USB_pass_the_workers_bill_of_rights: "Pass the Worker's Bill of Rights"
 USB_pass_the_workers_bill_of_rights_desc: "The Domestic Worker's Bill of Rights Act is a proposed law guaranteeing domestic workers basic rights such as minimum wage, overtime pay, rest breaks, and safe working conditions. It also include protections against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation from their employers or other actors. While this may spark outrage from certain corporations influencing our government, this bill is a necessity to win over the common worker and ensure their freedom."
 USB_bolster_the_mic: "Bolster the Military Industrial Complex"
 USB_bolster_the_mic_desc: "The military-industrial complex, or the MIC, describes the relationship between a country's military, most often the United States, and the industry that fuels it. This expression is not foreign to our economy and has been used since President Eisenhower. In the speech where the term was coined, Eisenhower warned about it being a "looming threat", which nowadays, is far from the case. It has been drastically weakened in recent times. As our nation struggles through the most devastating conflict it has ever seen, we must revitalize the relationship between the defense industry and the military, by utilizing tactics such as political approval for military spending, lobbying to support bureaucracies, and joint oversight of the industry."
 USB_ease_burdens_of_the_forward_thinkers: "Ease Burdens of the Forward Thinkers"
 USB_ease_burdens_of_the_forward_thinkers_desc: "Technological innovation and progress have always been at the forefront of economic expansion. As far back as the days of Rockefeller and Bessemer whose innovations led to massive leaps in the steel and oil industry, forward thinkers have accelerated the development of industrial technology. As a part of our attempts to work closer with the major industrial giants of America, we have made an effort to subsidize these forward thinkers so that they may help us to their fullest extent. Our success relies on them, and if we wish to secure a future for our democracy they must be supported."
 USB_promote_managerial_thought: "Promote Managerial Thought"
 USB_promote_managerial_thought_desc: "Managerial Thought is, simply put, the art of getting things done by making the best use of available resources. Organizational structure in general management has shifted dramatically over the centuries, leading to an explosion in the creation of ideas that, over time, would be considered crucial to understanding business. This theory should be applied to our current state, with the promotion of industrial sophistication being a necessity in these trying times. We must promote revision, restructuring, and renewal in all sectors of the economy if we want to achieve economic stability and victory against our adversaries."
 USB_utilize_artificial_intelligence: "Utilize Artificial Intelligence"
 USB_utilize_artificial_intelligence_desc: "Since the end of the 2010s, advancements in Artificial Intelligence have seen enormous breakthroughs, especially in fields such as cybersecurity, medical technology, military capabilities, finance, and other career settings. If we want to bolster economic efficiency and overall output, as well as make more room for recruitment by opening up job markets, we should invest in Artificial Technology and similar software, both in the civilian economy and for military use."
 USB_automated_weapon_production: "Automated Weapon Production"
 USB_automated_weapon_production_desc: "Lethal autonomous weapons, or LAWs, are weapons systems that can independently search for and engage targets based on their programming. They have quickly gone from science fiction movies and books to real-life weapon systems being mass-produced across the globe. They provide several vital military advantages, such as acting as a force multiplier; fewer infantrymen and combat systems needed for a single operation, and the efficacy of which is greater. Next, they are capable of expanding the battlefield, allowing combat to reach into areas that were previously inaccessible. Finally, LAWs can reduce casualties by removing humans from dangerous missions. Despite receiving criticism on all fronts, it is clear that the benefits outweigh the risks, and we should begin investment, research, and mass-production of LAWs as well as begin developing ways to make them more reliable."
 USB_uphold_american_consumerism: "Uphold American Consumerism"
 USB_uphold_american_consumerism_desc: "American Consumerism is the foundation for which our peace-time civilian economy has stood upon for decades after the Second World War. Smashed by the ongoing Civil War which has devastated our civilian economy, we should begin launchng economic campaigns to increase civilian spending power, restructuring economic materialism and pulling our economy out of depression. As the saying goes: "so as the U.S. consumer goes, so goes the U.S. economy.""
 USB_sack_luxury_goods_production: "Sack Luxury Goods Production"
 USB_sack_luxury_goods_production_desc: "In the crisis that has fully engulfed what once was the United States of America, we need to fully shape our economy around the war machine and civilian necessities to keep morale high in these trying times, simply put: there is no room for luxuries in the American economy at this point, and we should not tolerate luxury production. We will sack luxury goods, rediverting them to the war economy and expenditures to fight poverty and keep civilian finances afloat to ensure victory over the rats hiding in Denver. Every American will do his part to reach prosperity and victory, even those at the very top hiding in executive offices."
 USB_use_our_industrial_base: "Use our Industrial Base"
 USB_use_our_industrial_base_desc: "The Defense Industrial Base, or DIB, is the vast network of people, organizations, facilities, and resources that provide the Department of Defense defense-related materials, products, and services, being an instrumental part of the military-industrial complex and has been increasing in productivity, efficiency and output since the end of the Second World War. That is, until the outbreak of the bloodiest conflict in American history. Now that our democracy is under siege on all sides, we must revitalize the Defense Industrial Base and bolster its production."
 USB_supercharge_the_war_machine: "Supercharge the War Machine"
 USB_supercharge_the_war_machine_desc: "The final battle for American democracy has come. We must divert everything to the war economy, ensuring victory over the snakes in Denver."
 USB_technological_revolution: "Technological Revolution"
 USB_technological_revolution_desc: "Despite being the second most technologically advanced country in the world, and on track to become the first, that record was broken by the onset of the Second Civil War which has engulfed our nation at every corner. No aspect of American society, especially technology, was left untouched by the effects of it; something we must reverse immediately. If our destiny is victory and the establishment of a new age for American democracy, we must continue the development and advancement of technology, in both military and public settings, despite whatever the future may hold. Another technological revolution is inevitable if we strive for it, which we must."
 USB_crackdown_on_war_profiteering: "Crackdown on War Profiteering"
 USB_crackdown_on_war_profiteering_desc: "One of the most prevalent issues effecting our economy is the copious amounts of profiteering done by corporations, specifically ones with a hand in the military-industrial complex. Not only has it gutted the MIC, it has also drove up record amounts of inflation and destroyed civilian spending, pushing up consumer prices. Reckless war profiteering has especially been terrible, with CEOs of major military contractors enjoying a big jump in the value of their personal stock holdings due to the Civil War. In a civilized democracy, this has no place, and we should try to phase it out as much as possible."
 USB_a_hand_on_our_shoulder: "A Hand on Our Shoulder"
 USB_a_hand_on_our_shoulder_desc: "The contributions corporations have made to both our war effort and the home front have been innumerable. They have backed us at every turn, both politically and economically, and have aided in the struggle for liberty and democracy everywhere. We must continue to build their strength and influence, whatever the cost may be if we want to be victorious in the end. A series of special privileges will be granted to these conglomerates, giving them free reins and more political influence to help guide us along the right path. However, this may have some unintended side effects if not handled correctly..."
 USB_nationalize_the_war_effort: "Nationalize the War Effort"
 USB_nationalize_the_war_effort_desc: "The corporations at the top of the defense industry have been bleeding the American people dry, and that should become obvious with each passing day that the Civil War rages on. Not only do these military conglomerates, such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon Technologies, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, hold significant influence politically, they have been engaging in a superabundant amount of war profiteering, something which we have tried to eliminate. They have acted as leeches on our civilian economy, diminishing it and racking up profits while our boys on the ground fight for their lives against tyrants. This is where we, the people, draw a line in the sand and say: "no more" to war profiteering, "no more" to corporate lobbying, and "no more" to the private defence industry. We will nationalize the war effort and crush these roaches before their infestation destroys America further."
 
 USB_implement_the_green_new_deal_desc: "In the past few years, climate-based activism has grown to reach one of the forefronts of American politics, with calls to act on and further the reduction of emissions having only gotten louder. As a result of an increasing public focus towards the wellbeing of the planet, a number of progressive politicians had endorsed and put forward the Green New Deal; a program designed to massively cut back on and eventually shut down numerous emission-heavy industries, while providing financial cover to those who would be affected by the transition to a much more green economy. Though such a costly endeavor had been ruthlessly opposed by most Republicans, the notable absence of a majority of those resisting its consideration has once again brought the proposal into the limelight. While some might criticize its implementation during wartime, the opportunity for real climate policy is too beneficial to pass up. This will be the first step in America's contribution to climate sustainability - and it is a step we will all take together."
 USB_restore_the_soul_of_the_nation: "Restore The Soul Of The Nation"
 USB_restore_the_soul_of_the_nation_desc: "When the civil war began, a significant portion of Republican senators and congressmen threw their lot in with the illegitimate government in Denver, showcasing to the country their treachery and lapsed commitments to the democratic process in favour of an egomaniac. Few considered the sensible Republicans - the ones who made the right choice in recognizing our legitimacy as the true American government - to ever be able to recover their image among the Union's populace, even if they remained on the right side of history in the end. Despite the hardships, however, the Union's GOP has put forth a great effort to rebuild their image; effectively rebranding themselves against the stigma surrounding Donald Trump's gaggle of traitors, and their hostility towards democracy. The new Republican Party, it seems, has taken a new turn - a turn defining themselves as not populistic demagogues, but sensible and headstrong social conservatives, soulful and patriotic in defense of their love for democracy and the constitution, while simultaneously being willing to compromise with their opposition for the greater good of the country. With much thanks to the President's efforts, it appears that America's soul has been reforged in the sense of passion, reason, and a love for one's country, envisioned by the true, legitimate and rehabilitated Republican Party."
 USB_lower_our_debts: "Expand the PATRIOT Act"
 USB_lower_our_debts_desc: "The PATRIOT Act, officially the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act, was passed in the wake of 9/11 and a wave of terrorist attacks on the United States and our allies abroad. It allows us to search digital records and expose potential terrorist plots at will, which proved to be greatly effective in the 2000s. Now, our domestic situation has worsened drastically. The onset of insurgencies within our borders and traitors running rampant across the States' should warrant a series of amendments to the 2001 Act, increasing its scope. We must fight terrorism, sedition and insurgency wherever it appears, especially in the digital realm."
 USB_cut_down_on_social_programs: "Cut Down On Social Programs"
 USB_cut_down_on_social_programs_desc: "While it is an unfortunate reality, the truth of the matter is that if we are to emerge victorious over Trump's band of traitors, we must fully embrace a war economy - and that means cutting down on social programs, such as income assistance, rental assistance, healthcare, food assistance and general welfare. While this is bound to receive popular opposition, it is a necessity that federal funding be redirected to the war machine to secure victory on the frontlines."

 USB_an_end_to_strife_desc: "Across the tattered visage of the United States, an atmosphere of hope has begun to settle into the broken landscape. As the explosions cease and the guns fall silent, people all over the country have started to approach the realization that the most devastating conflict of the 21st century has finally come to an end; tearful, joyous celebrations have begun to ring out in the streets of cities and towns as the seemingly endless inner conflict has seen its long-awaited conclusion. The Union has won the war, but our work is far from over. The nation lies in ruin, with many fires still lit and areas reduced to rubble. Untold thousands upon thousands of Americans have perished as parents bury their children over a war that should have never happened in the first place. Before us lie bridges in need of building; wounds to mend, scars to fade away. In the name of unity and healing, let us all move forward, indivisible, as one - together."

 USB_pass_the_economic_freedom_act_desc: "With the lives of so many Americans now in disarray as a result of this tragic civil war, it is highly important for us to maintain that their livelihoods are not subject to even further ruin. With the futures of so many citizens appearing devastatingly uncertain, measures once considered fiscally radical by our opposition have become nothing short of a moral obligation for us to enact. The Economic Freedom Act will ensure that we do just that; by forwarding Universal Basic Income for the first time as well as additional stimulus checks to those in need, we can help keep the lives of American citizens afloat during this turbulent period in our history. Granted, the program's benefits are a far cry from what we had initially desired to provide, due to financial constraints as a result of the war - however, this landmark bill for social spending and the wealth inequality issue is a triumph of its own, one that will undoubtedly remain for the forseeable future. In addition to this, the government will be granted the ability to seize the assets of certain companies who have otherwise refused to cooperate with us, in their foolish preferences towards Denver or any other secessionist."
 USB_expand_the_militarys_funding: "Expand The Military's Funding"
 USB_expand_the_militarys_funding_desc: "The American military, while ripe with funding and decorated in glories, atleast before the Civil War, has been left critically underfunded recently, unable to meet several financial quotas and expectations. This has hindered performance on both the frontlines and against partisans, who are making light work of our unprepared and poorly equipped soldiers. If we want to see through victory and liberation, we must divert federal reserves to the military and begin the streamlining of equipment, at the cost of slashing civilian industry."
 USB_expand_the_cia: "Expand The CIA"
 USB_expand_the_cia_desc: "As the ongoing effort to root out dissidents and other potential dangers continues, it has been determined that further resources must be allocated to our intelligence branches if we are to adequately maintain and expand our more covert activities. Although they have done an exemplary job thus far with the resources they have been given, the sheer scale of this war has led to a clear need for an increased level of financial and operational commitment. In order to maintain superiority in the world of information-gathering, the Central Intelligence Agency will be expanded in terms of funding, support, and organizational prowess and efficiency. Secret operations will be actively increased and further connections will be made in order to secure and advance the position of the Union. The agency will once more remain ten steps ahead of anyone rearing their heads to strike us in our time of weakness, be they foreign or homegrown."
 USB_professionalize_the_army: "Professionalize The Army"
 USB_professionalize_the_army_desc: "The status of our frontline units has come far, in comparison to when the war first began. The formerly common reports of AWOL soldiers have grown rare, with units that were formerly disobedient and of questionable loyalty now marching in tandem with the orders the top brass sends out; the reorganization of the federal army is largely complete, with our troops performing much more up to the standard expected of them as soldiers of the Union. With most of our immediate issues taken care of, it is time that we fully return to the status of a professional army, with the necessary commitment to match. The few troublesome individuals who remain questionable or bothersome in terms of loyalty will be rooted out and either transferred, replaced, demoted, or discharged in exchange for more level-headed personnel. In addition to securing the support of the army, this will allow us to reduce the necessity of the many hastily-composed civilian militias filling in for the frontline."
 USB_overclock_arms_production: "Overclock Arms Production"
 USB_overclock_arms_production_desc: "Our position on the frontline is a precarious one. While our largely federal army is no doubt advantageous against the Trumpist militias to the west, our armies are admittedly fewer in number when compared to the size of their forces. With this reality, a number of our strategists and generals have proposed that we undertake a doctrine of defense and entrenchment, seeing it as the best possible option for our current predicament of facing a vast frontline.  Rather than relentlessly attack and potentially find ourselves routed, our forces will instead dig in to face the onslaught of traitors as they make their futile attempts to advance - crashing against our defensive walls until an opportunity presents itself to counterattack where they are most vulnerable. They want to overthrow our elected government so badly? Let them come - they'll have to fight us tooth and nail for every inch of territory under the Union's banner!"
 USB_blitz_for_the_heartland: "Blitz For The Heartland"
 USB_blitz_for_the_heartland_desc: "Despite the galvanized enemy militias upon the frontline, it is hardly a secret that they remain at a notable disadvantage in comparison to the Union's professional, conventional army. Although our forces are undoubtedly superior, it is clear that the enemy's forces considerably outnumber our own, a rather unfortunate fact in our strategic situation. This has led a number of our military leaders to suggest adopting a doctrine of offensive manuevers in an effort to assault and overwhelm enemy forces before they are able to recuperate. In the words of many great strategic leaders, 'the best defence is a good offence'. Instead of remaining passive in the face of the traitors to our west, we will concentrate our efforts in advancing upon the enemy rather than waiting for them to make the first move, with well-planned attacks in order to dislodge and surround them where they stand. The Union will sweep across the great plains and the rocky mountains, pushing the bastards to their very limit as they come to dread the very storm they asked for."
 USB_subversive_warfare: "Subversive Warfare"
 USB_subversive_warfare_desc: "Upon the formation of the frontline, it has become glaringly apparent the enemy has us largely outnumbered in the field. With the threat of possibly being routed and overrun as a result of their numerical advantage over us, it appears that we must reform to a more unorthodox level of military strategy. Due to our switch from more conventional military doctrines to more assymetrical ones, many within the general staff have brought forth the idea of engaging in warfare based around the strategy of subversion and harassment. Instead of facing our enemies in the traditional sense, we will practice a form of war the enemy will likely not expect - by means of well-planned ambushes, guerilla-like tactics, trapping, and other means of fighting all while remaining largely defensive, the enemy will soon find it inreasingly difficult to effectively make gains on us without facing well-trained resistance around every corner - ensuring that, even if we must fall back, the enemy will not go unharassed. The so-called 'patriots' thought that they were the only ones who understood subversion - they're going to learn very quickly that two can play at that game."
 USB_mass_mobilization: "Mass Mobilization"
 USB_mass_mobilization_desc: "As the war continues, we have been faced with an unfortunate truth. As much as we wish it were different, the enemy in Denver has forces which vastly outnumber our own - comprised of zealous militias and traitorous elements of the army, this leaves us in something of a tight spot. With this inconvenient factor of ours, some within our top brass have suggested that we utilize our recent decision to move away from more conventional means in an effort to effectively mobilize the population on an unprecedented scale. With the increased efforts to recruit and organize more of the civilian population into militias, we will hold waves of brave soldiers valiantly defending our democracy against treason and autocracy - allowing us to organize massive, well-planned assaults and advances against the enemy in a time where manpower is necessary for our survival. The Trumpist forces will tremble as the fighting men of the Union storm across their territory, emboldened by a desire to crush their enemies where they stand."
 USB_practice_subversive_warfare: "Practice Subversive Warfare"
 USB_practice_subversive_warfare_desc: "With our efforts to professionalize the Union's armed forces, it is only natural that we move on to the next step of operation education. Despite the previous experience and quality training our armies have received (both before and during the outbreak of the war), it is important that we take the appropriate measures to educate and adapt them to fighting on American soil. With so much at stake, it is important that we keep the troops informed and knowledgeable of battlefield efficiency."
 USB_politicize_the_army: "Politicize The Army"
 USB_politicize_the_army_desc: "Make no mistake - this war is more than just a mere bloody dispute regarding the transfer of power. In essence, it is a fight for the very values that this nation has been built upon and refined towards; democracy, liberty, and equal rights for all. The Union stands as the last true bastion of these values, ones held dearly by every sane American; it is incredibly important that we instill these values into our soldiers, to remind them what they're fighting for and what they lay down their lives daily to protect. For a good soldier fights not because they hate what lies ahead of them, but because they loves what lays behind them."
 USB_enforce_the_second_ammendment: "Enforce The Second Amendment"
 USB_enforce_the_second_ammendment_desc: "Although the initial position by many mainstream politicians within the Democratic Party has been one of contempt and disdain towards the constitutional basis for firearm ownership, the recent direction in which we have taken our military doctrines has led us to re-examine this position. While our previous attempts to ban private gun ownership are likely fresh in the minds of many, this little walkback of ours should come as a pleasant, albeit sudden surprise for them. By enforcing and reapplying the second amendment into law and practice once again, we will be able to both calm the more stalwart gun owners, as well as encourage those hesitant moderates to put their firearms to good use against the enemy to our west."
 USB_militarize_society: "Militarize Society"
 USB_militarize_society_desc: "Our recent strides in the large-scale mobilization of the populace have seen beneficial results. We have accumulated a vast array of fresh, motivated fighters at our disposal, we have become considerably more prepared to counteract the manpower of our adversaries in the field of battle. Comprised largely of recruited and trained civilians in addition to already-existing federal units, these militias will be crucial in overrunning the enemy's positions. This massive effort to gather more fighters, however, has not come without its drawbacks. One of the more pressing issues is that many of the former civilians-turned soldiers have had some difficulty adjusting to the standards in which American soldiers are supposed to adhere to; be they in following orders, cooperating more effectively, or other disciplinary factors. While their enthusiasm is appreciated, we will not win this war without organization. We will begin efforts to whip these units into shape and ensure that they are able to hold themselves to a degree of professionalism expected from the defenders of American democracy."

 USB_fund_partisans_desc: "Our doctrinal efforts have begun to pay off, with the enemy finding their attempts at securing recently captured territory proving more difficult than they expected, our doctrinal efforts have begun to pay off. With an army of patriotic fighters from both civilian and veteran backgrounds, we have begun to wear the enemy's advance down in ways that help nullify their current battlefield advantages, with our subversive tactics throwing the enemy for a loop and our cunning militia forces remaining vital in our pursuits to harass the enemy. Despite these successes however, we must up the ante. While we have been able to inflict notable damage upon the enemy, the threat of further advancements has only persisted over the course of this war. If we are to win this fight, we must increase our efforts to subvert and sabotage the enemy around every corner - partisan groups consisting of those loyal to the Union will reside and operate behind enemy lines, waging an insurrectionary war alongside collaborators in primarily urban areas. From here, the enemy's already troublesome occupation efforts will soon turn into nothing short of a nightmare altogether."
 USB_expand_gun_ownership: "Expand Gun Ownership"
 USB_expand_gun_ownership_desc: "With our recent efforts to cultivate civilian preparedness having been successful, it has been determined that these efforts must be taken a step further to ensure maximum reliability among the population. With the influx of manpower as a result of our non-conventional outlook, we must encourage and ensure that our non-serving citizens remain prepared in the face of the enemy's onslaught - gun ownership will be incentivized and encouraged, and several programs ranging from firearm training to general attack readiness will be put in place, designed to ready the population in case the worst comes to pass. All must be ready and able to defend our democracy, even if they are not enlisted."
 USB_extend_the_supply_network: "Extend The Supply Network"
 USB_extend_the_supply_network_desc: "The Union's officer staff is a mixed bag; thanks to our posession of most of the federal army, our ranks consist of those both with seniority experience from past conflicts, as well as those fresh graduates who have found themselves with a talent for leadership within the battlefield. While the presence of younger people achieving officer status is ultimately a good sign of future strategic promise, number of shortcomings within their command performances have been noticed, largely due to a lack of in-field experience and the lack of familiarity with a conflict as large as this one. In addition to this, older officers have begun to experience difficulties with updating their methods, likely for similar reasons regarding the nature of this war. An inexperienced or otherwise rigid officer corps is sure to translate into poor decisions later on; to avoid this, we will immediately begin an effort to re-train our officers in order to better suit their leadership skills to our current situation, and ensure that our men are in good, capable hands for the fight ahead."
 USB_race_against_the_clock: "Race Against The Clock"
 USB_race_against_the_clock_desc: "Our taken direction regarding the defining of the values in which our army fights for has ultimately proven beneficial. With our Union having cemented itself as the side that fights for social and political progress of all types, be they minority and equality rights, political and economic reform, and any other modern cause for freedom and tolerance, we have seen a notable uptick in both recruitment and support from the populace. With these recent successes, it is high time we make use of them. Many activists that took to the streets to protest before the war were among the most staunchly committed to progress and anti-authoritarianism of all stripes, especially in the face of the Trump administration. By encouraging and mobilizing the members and activists from the pre-war movements, we will see an even greater rise in eager recruits, desiring to both fight for a better, more equal and modern nation, as well as defending it from those who wish to plunge us into a backwards notion of what America should be. With some of the most vocal anti-Trump individuals in our ranks, they will undoubtedly fight with zeal in the face of such a familiar tyranny."
 USB_caution_over_land: "Caution Over Land"
 USB_caution_over_land_desc: "Although the influx of fresh soldiers is ultimately a great sign of the younger generation's adaption and skill at the art of war, it has not presented itself without a few missing key qualities. While they have a good sense of intuition and improvisation, they have generally lacked the knowledge and experience in regards to in-field strategy, leaving their combative performance to be less effective than it can be. If we are to maintain a level of cohesive efficiency among units in the battlefield, it is vital that they be taught the nature of combative tactics and other methods of assault and defense designed to give them an edge when it comes to facing the enemy, regardless of who it will be."
 USB_allied_assistance: "Allied Assistance"
 USB_allied_assistance_desc: "When it comes to this conflict, it has been made abundantly clear that the key to victory lies not only in the soldiers and the tactics that they engage in against the enemy, but the equipment that they wield as well. Even though our armies are more than capable of defending themselves from strung-out militias, it is foolish to assume that we will hold this advantage forever. With our access to a majority of the long-enjoyed military industrial complex, we will make good use of our connections - ensuring that our soldiers always have the best and most modern equipment at their disposal."
 USB_requistion_civilian_firearms: "Requistion Civilian Firearms"
 USB_requistion_civilian_firearms_desc: "Our commitment to a defensive stance against our enemies requires a pivotal effort to maintain our engineering capabilities in the field, especially with a country as industrialized and infrastructure-heavy as ours. Though our current engineers are far from inadequate, they are rather unsuited to such large-scale operations suitable for a vast frontline, especially one taking place on their home territory. In order to rectify this oversight, we will begin to bolster the role of the Army Corps of Engineers - instructing and adapting them to the terrain and infrastructure of American soil in order to maximize our fortification efficiency and expertise."
 USB_full_spectrum_operations: "Full Spectrum Operations"
 USB_full_spectrum_operations_desc: "The doctrine of rapid advancement and encirclement is a doctrine that has been tried and tested throughout history on a number of fronts on a variety of different scales. While our top military minds had certainly learned to appreciate the value of mobility tactics from our NATO allies, we hadn't exactly accounted for this doctrine to be applied to our home terrain. If we are to maintain and apply this doctrine effectively, we must ensure that our vehicular capabilities remain top of the line in terms of acquiring newer models to use in the battlefield."
 USB_operation_mirage: "Operation: Mirage"
 USB_operation_mirage_desc: "Prior to the war, it was without question that the United States held massive influence throughout the world. Ranging from our influence within the United Nations, to our status as the foremost member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, our status as the world's great superpower was second to none, apart from a few lagging contenders. Although this conflict of ours has regrettably caused our presence on the global stage to, er, completely and utterly collapse, we are not fully in the dark; despite the circumstances, we have maintained connections with a great number of our pre-war foreign allies and affiliates. With these connections, we will begin contacting and seeking their expertise. We will request and utilize the relationships maintained with our allies in the form of military attaches, allowing a modicum of foreign advisors from our European allies and abroad to assist and aid our efforts to secure our nation once more. As our predicament has undoubtedly affected them as well as the rest of the world, it is certain that they too wish to see this conflict ended as soon as possible, with their combative know-how soon to be proved valuable for our forces."

 USB_finish_the_fight_desc: "From our initial situation upon the outbreak of the war, the state of our armed forces and it's rejuvenation has been a long and difficult journey to rectify and improve - a journey that has ultimately paid off, in the highest of regards. Where there had once been disorganization and ineffectiveness, there is cohesion and professionalism, prepared and knowledgeable in the means of  fighting on American soil. Where there had been disloyal and defective soldiers now stand strong, proud forces vindicated in their desire to strike down the enemies of our free democracy where they stand - at home, or anywhere else. Now, the army of the Union is one unrivalled in their devotion against tyranny, and with the bulk of the reforms being finished, all that is left is to finalize the last few reforms needed to truly ensure that our forces will forever act as a bulwark against traitors and other radicals seeking to destroy the fundamental principles of this nation. For as long as they stand, we will never yield in the face of tyranny and darkness."

 USB_cooperate_with_the_corporations_desc: "Despite what the idealistic progressives would want you to think, the nature of government-business cooperation has been one of largely mutual benefit since its inception. With their vast amount of economic influence, it's not an unusual revelation that generally, the improved conditions of these corporations ultimately translates into an improved economy, that likewise benefits the rest of American society. For this reason, we will begin making strides to maintain this relationship of ours - both to further the Union's interests, and to ensure these companies that so long as we see results, our economy will function just fine."
 USB_fight_the_corporatocracy: "Fight The Corporatocracy"
 USB_fight_the_corporatocracy_desc: "Although the corporate puppets in congress would prefer you believe otherwise, the idea of "mutual benefit" between the country's largest corporations is, at best, an ignorant viewpoint - and at worst, an utter scam. The influence that these massive conglomerates have accumulated over the government's decision-making over the past several decades has amounted to nothing short of a stranglehold, with the truth being that a vast majority of these businesses care little for the common citizen outside of their working usefulness, and their "cooperation" is nothing more than a way they ensure greater profits through endless amounts of lobbying. Now that war has broken out, and these corporations stand in a beneficial - yet vulnerable - position, it is high time that we begin to root out this violation of democratic principle. We will begin pushing back on their influence over congressional politics as a first step to remind them who really holds the power in this country - and to remind our lawmakers who they were elected to serve."
 USB_the_unification_deal: "The Unification Deal"
 USB_the_unification_deal_desc: "Although our maintained cooperation with the various present conglomerates has undoubtedly been very fruitful in alleviating our collapsed economy, it has become quite apparent that the coordination between the government and the most prominent of these businesses is much less organized than we had initially hoped. With the political and market landscape having become so shaken up as a result of this war, there has more often than not been conflicting interests between the government and these companies (with these companies conflicting with each other almost as much as they do with congress). If we are to efficiently function in tandem with these businesses, it is pivotal that we enter talks with the most influential ones under the Union's banner, in order to better realign our directives and determine where these corporations fit in with America's slowly recovering economy."

 USB_expand_global_trade_desc: "Before the war, the United States held a vast amount of trading and economic influence across the global markets, with the power of the U.S dollar having been representative of our position as one of the world's foremost economic powerhouses. Having long-since enjoyed the benefits of a capitalist economy, we were nearly untouchable in this aspect; only making our fall from grace (more akin to a fiery crash) only even more tragic in the end. Needless to say, we are far from the only ones affected by this tremendous shakeup in the global market chain, with our largest trading partners likewise experiencing the harsh ramifications as a result of our collapse. With our access to the eastern seaboard being a great advantage in our connection to the outside world, we have been able to maintain some of the trade we held before, albeit in a greatly reduced capacity. In order to help kickstart the aspects of the global economy we once took for granted, we will make efforts to expand our trading operations with our most reliable foreign partners - allowing for us to receive some much-needed aid and resources from the world community once again."
 USB_american_autarky: "American Autarky"
 USB_american_autarky_desc: "The global economy is an undoubtedly important market for any nation seeking to keep itself financially stable and prepared resource-wise. Prior to our woes, this country understood this better than most trade contenders, to the point where we had emerged as one of the world's most prominent figures in the world market. While we reaped the benefits of outsourcing and globalization for quite some time, it slowly paved the road for a new slew of creeping problems and disadvantages that have arguably made the collapse of our economy far worse than we could have ever predicted it to be - an over-reliance on foreign labor has rendered many of our economic sectors drastically lacking in self-sufficiency, rendering these areas economically ineffective and many workers destitute. If we are to ever recover from this catastrophe, it is time for a change of course; we will begin to revitalize our production sectors to be considerably less reliant on overseas forces, ensuring that even with a reduced hand in trade, we will still be able to hold our own economically without being at the mercy of the foreign markets. In addition to increasing our economic capabilities, this will also grant some much-needed influence back to the average worker, leaving them with much more bargaining leverage than they've had in recent years."
 USB_military_factory_conversion: "Military Factory Conversion"
 USB_military_factory_conversion_desc: "As our commitment to wartime production continues, so does the need for viable production centres. While our current number of factories producing frontline equipment is no doubt seeing great results, the fact of the matter is that there simply aren't enough facilities in the Union that are equipped to properly match the production the war effort demands. To that end, we will begin refitting and properly converting a number of civilian and consumer-oriented factories to ones oriented to manufacturing the much-needed equipment required to defeat the traitors wherever they stand."

Luckily for us, we have been fortunate enough to maintain a significant portion of the Rust Belt, leaving us under control of what is arguably America's industrial heartland. In order to prevail against the forces of treason and extremism that surround us, we must make a concerted effort to mobilize our economy in a way not seen since the Second World War. Current facilities will be refitted and reorganized to mass-produce necessary equipment, and the American machine will once more be geared towards seeing our Union to victory. In addition, the populace will be encouraged to assist the war effort when they can, through means of morale, recruitment, and other homefront means of supporting the arm of democracy in America. Remember, we're all in it for the effort!"

As our production continues to grow in scale and magnitude, as does our need for the materials necessary to make it happen; in order to keep up with the demands of the war machine and the public apparatus, we will begin a mass acquisition of the required resources, with a number of available steel mills and other similar facilities increasing their capacity to produce what we very much need."

While still nowhere close to the level of international trade and relative prosperity we had enjoyed prior to the collapse, the status of our economy has been vastly improved in comparison to the opening stages of the war. With our situation slowly but surely looking upwards, let us make greater strides to get the Union back on track; our efforts to re-cultivate trade with foreign nations will be expanded, with a number of overtures made to market partners both old and new to negotiate new trade deals for the benefit of our economic wellbeing.

 USB_expand_our_research_desc: "In regards to developmental research - be it industrial, technological, military or otherwise - it is important that the Union does not fall behind on this matter. While we have thus far done well to keep up with the technological advancements that grant us an edge in production and general societal wellbeing, we mustn't settle for what may be considered obsolete in the future - rather, we must remain one step ahead of our adversaries whenever possible. We will set forth a number of subsidies and funds towards a variety of research groups and institutions, in order to see a greater increase in R&D capacity and results overall."
 USB_improve_employee_benefits: "Improve Employee Benefits"
 USB_improve_employee_benefits_desc: "It is an open secret that, in comparison to most of the first world nations, the state of the American workforce has long-since been nothing short of abysmal. Even before the war, the existing benefits that were offered to workers were miniscule in regards to what was actually needed for their lives to be both financially and socially secure - be it a lack of paid maternity leave, barebones insurance benefits, crackdowns on workers unions, and other intended shortcomings designed only to satiate the greed of the already high-earning employers. With the influence of many of the Union's corporations severely waning, it is time that we use this opportunity to "catch up", so-to-speak. A number of mandatory benefits will be passed into law and rolled out at the earliest opportunity for the largest businesses - granting our working citizens with provisions they should have acquired long ago. Although the executives may howl about their newfound responsibilities to their employees, it matters little; besides, they shouldn't have started a company if they can't afford to care for their laborers."

As engraved upon Lady Liberty, this country has always been an advocate for bringing the masses to greater, prosperous heights no matter where they came from originally - and our economy greatly reflected the importance of foreign labor as an overall positive. Although the prospect of the "American Dream" no longer holds the exciting and hopeful implications as it once did (for obvious reasons), there is ample opportunity for us to turn this around. With the Union's global trade having been greatly expanded in the past several months, it is only fitting that we seek to improve our capacities even further. By importing workers from overseas via a number of programs, we will be able to commit greater efforts towards a number of projects and fields, ranging from wartime and consumer production, reconstruction, and other positions that need filling in exchange for adequate financial compensation. In addition to this, we will assist our previously multinational corporations in order to kickstart their productive capabilities in foreign countries once again - far away from the conflict at home."

 USB_curtail_corporate_commitments_desc: "As this war has progressed and this nation is forever changed, the economic apparatus of the state has likewise changed as well. Prior to the war, the American economy was not geared towards the general wellbeing of our society - rather being geared to the shareholders and executives who held all the monetary power that the average citizen could only dream of attaining. As we have strived to cut their leisures in order to adapt to our situation, the power and influence that these corporations hold pales greatly in comparison to what once was, with our newly-acquired self-sufficiency making the Union stronger than it's been in years. With their influence shrinking drastically with each passing day, it time that we cement these changes to persist even after this war. We will make a final effort to curtail the last vestiges of economic power that these businesses hold, rendering their say in politics to be moot against the word of the government. As expected, the CEO's and board members will be outraged at their last inkling of economic importance being ripped away; but really, where else are they going to go exactly?"

With the catastrophic economic crisis before the war and the arrival of the conflict itself, the number of impoverished American citizens have continued to grow as our economy slowly but surely recovers from its collapse. While we have made significant progress in speeding up its recovery, the recovery of the citizens affected by our economic downturn has been generally less effective than we had hoped. In order to formally solve this crisis plaguing the American people, a number of poverty relief programs will be implemented with the effect of alleviating their suffering and assisting their current conditions, with the hopes that we will eventually mitigate the poverty rates to pre-crisis levels or lower."

Despite these necessary wartime alterations, one thing remains unchanged for the better - the beneficial relationship between the government and the many businesses that contribute to our economy. Being the natural, pragmatic choice in the face of a destroyed economy in need of remedying, our cooperation is one that has seen mutual successes in both the Union's prosperity as well as the prosperity of the biggest contributors. With the proverbial Board of Directors satisfied with our engagements and committed to serving us dutifully, it is time that we firmly entrench our relationship with these corporations - we will be made to ensure that their role in the economy will  continue as the country continues to bounce back from it's collapse, as long as they remain content with our decisions and yield when we request they do so."
 USB_bust_the_trusts: "Bust The Trusts"
 USB_bust_the_trusts_desc: "The term 'too big to fail' has been one coined by many establishment politicians over the years since the 2008 financial crisis brought our economic situation into the limelight. Stated to represent the necessity of this country's all-powerful businesses to the continued stability of not just our own markets, but the world's as well. Through this colossal importance came great influence - allowing leverage over legislators and the policies they put forward, be it directly through campaign donations or through vast amounts of corporate lobbying, all done in order to further their profit motives and market successes. With the civil war throwing a wrench into this status quo, however, we will see to it that the Union has everything it needs to ensure its political and economic survival. Sweeping anti-trust legislation will be put forward, effectively breaking up these business giants and allowing us to seize some of their much-needed assets for better use, as well as greatly reducing their ability to influence congressional affairs through the prevention of lobbying for business interests. Let us leave politics to the politicians."

 USB_trust_funding_desc: "While the United States has been no stranger to economic downturn throughout its history, there are few financial crises that come close to our current state of total catastrophe. With the recent oil crisis plunging our economy into a freefall, and the outbreak of civil conflict soon after, an untold number of our citizens have become impoverished and without work due to the total economic collapse that continues to plague our nation. Due to the nature of our economy, our road to recovery largely depends on the success of our largest businesses, of which have been in severely dire straits even prior to the collapse. With this mind, we will begin the allocation of funds towards the most pivotal of these businesses - allowing them to mediate their financial situation, and increasing employment for those desperately seeking work opportunities after the collapse. As jobs will once again return to the Union, this will be a great boon for the public's faith in our government - after all, what's best for the largest corporations is ultimately best for everyone."

 USB_take_to_the_skies_desc: ""To have command of the air means to be able to cut an enemy's army and navy off from their bases of operation and nullify their chances of winning the war." While our war against the Constitutionalists primarily consists of ground-based engagements, we mustn't forget about the war in the skies. We must take the initiative to contest or control Constitutionalist airspace to provide our ground force with strategic air support. We also need to support our Air Force so they do not become overextended. If we allow the force to fail, then we will lose the war as quickly as it started."
 USB_quality: "Testing Our Limits"
 USB_quality_desc: "When it comes to aerial efficiency, we have always sought to push further - through military research and development, we continued to defy what was once thought impossible. With new prototypes and breakthroughs in aeronautical engineering surfacing every day, lies ample opportunity to utilise the next-generation of technological prowess in the battlefield. By focusing our efforts on ensuring that the best and newest models are put to good use in the field, we can outclass our enemies by placing an emphasis on quality aircraft, rather than quantity."
 USB_quantity: "Plentiful Plane Production"
 USB_quantity_desc: "While our efforts to contest Constitutionalist airspace have been mostly successful, we have encountered another problem. We are losing planes faster than we can produce them. While this has yet to become a serious issue if we allow it to fester it will seriously hamper our war effort. Therefore it is imperative that we ramp up production of planes of all types, regardless if we must cut corners. If successful, we will be able to solve the issue of attrition as well as cut down on unemployment."
 USB_drone_techniques: "Drone Techniques"
 USB_drone_techniques_desc: "The usage of drones against insurgent targets is hardly an unknown practice of U.S combative policy. Highly effective at pinpointing and terminating clusters of hostiles and critical individuals, and with their availability in smaller sizes, they have proven time and time again to be an invaluable asset to anti-terror operations globally. It is important that we utilize this technology and the necessary tactics as effectively as we can on the frontline, especially with such a large combative area and home infrastructure. As the enemy is soon to find out, it is much less enjoyable to be on the receiving end of such strikes than it is piloting them."
 USB_air_base_efforts: "Air Base Efforts"
 USB_air_base_efforts_desc: "While we have been successful in our air war with the Constitutionalists, we face the imminent danger of overextending ourselves too much. While we can support the war effort with our current bases, this will change as we take back more land from Trump. It will become necessary to repair former Constitutionalist airbases. this will ensure that our Air Force can properly provide our army with air support. These airbases will also mitigate the threat of our airforce being stretched to things, which would greatly slow the war effort."
 USB_ariel_discipline: "Aerial Discipline"
 USB_ariel_discipline_desc: "From the initial outbreak of the civil war, the USAF had been in a state of haphazardness due to the chaos that came with the collapse. Though much more loyal than some other parts of the military, the influx of new personnel and the overall disorganization that had originally permeated the armed forces was still ever present in  the way they carried out operational tasks. As our recent efforts to smooth out more definitive aerial tactics have begun to pay off, let us translate that into a renewed sense of discipline for the bird-eyed defenders of our freedom. Drills will be tightened, coordination will be enhanced, formations will be perfected, and our pilots will once again operate with iron-clad efficiency against the enemies of democracy with frightening precision."
 USB_strategic_destruction: "Strategic Destruction"
 USB_strategic_destruction_desc: "The art of targeted destruction is pivotal in any war, especially one taking place across such a vast battleground such as our own. As most half-decent strategists will know, it is significantly harder to fight a war when your supplies, weaponry, and the means to acquire them have been flattened to rubble by a well-placed bombing run. If we are to master this method of targeting, strides will have to be made to better suit carrying out such tactics against American-made structures. Pilots will be adjusted to targeting home terrain, and updated on how to effectively operate in familiar territory. With enough effort, our bombers will become a dreaded sight for the enemy to behold, no matter how reinforced they may be."
 USB_clear_the_heavens: "Clear The Heavens"
 USB_clear_the_heavens_desc: "Few can argue that the Union's Air Force remains one of the best in the world, with our modern record even before the war being nigh-untouchable in the face of lesser foes, and only largely continuing to hold true throughout the course of this conflict. Though it was to be expected, a number of groups have begun making the first steps in acquiring aircraft of their own, in the hopes that they will not only be able to thwart our aerial domination, but further threaten our own assets. While dogfighting and combative maneuvers have long been practiced by the USAF, they have scarcely been able to engage live targets until recently. If we are to keep the air effort under our control, we will begin to make sure that the fighting skill of our pilots remain unmatched against any possible upstart attempting to rival our supremacy up above, and that the heavens remain void of opposing planes to the benefit of our ground troops."
 USB_cover_the_troops: "Cover The Troops"
 USB_cover_the_troops_desc: "In the words of a great allied general; ''if we lose the war in the air, we lose the war, and quickly.'' While this absolutely applies to us, the very same applies to that of our enemies, in that it is much more difficult to organize and muster an effective position when you are beset upon by a squadron of determined fighter jets. By preparing and training the Air Force to effectively and accurately harass and attack ground targets, we will be able to inflict serious damage on any enemy force that believes itself to be well-prepared. In addition to softening up hostile forces for a ground assault, we will be able to protect our own troops from enemy aircraft opting to do the exact same against us."
 USB_clean_the_seas: "Clean The Seas"
 USB_clean_the_seas_desc: "Although very few of the participants in this war hold claim to any substantial number of ships, with the absence and neutrality of the majority of the U.S Navy, it is very possible that our lack of naval defences may prove troublesome in the future stages of this conflict. With a plethora of supplies being sent to the continent from abroad (be it assisting aid or otherwise), it has become quite clear just how open to sabotage our cargo may be. In order to attain some sort of capacity to protect the eastern seaboard and it's trade routes from possible targeting, we will begin preparations to ensure that the USAF is adequately skilled enough to both protect our existing ships and carry out airborne attacks on enemy vessels and frigates - especially in regards to possible supply convoys sent to them by foreign subversives attempting to undermine our authority. Until the navy returns to the fold, the Air Force will have to watch the waters."

 USB_reunify_the_nation_desc: "As the Trump forces continues to falter in the face of our onslaught, we have found ourselves once again under control of a number of midwestern states, with our progress westwards slowly moving onwards still. As we liberate more and more territory from the traitors in the west, however, so does the resistance from disgruntled civilian militias who have foolishly decided to stay behind and harass our garrisoned troopers. It is no secret that the populace of most rural areas we have gained control over are either at best unsupportive of our presence - and at worst, openly hostile and subversive. While the cities are usually a different story, we cannot simply rest on our laurels and put up with this difficult situation; efforts will be made to lower rebellious activity across the recently captured territory, and a sense of legitimacy will once again soon start to return to the affected regions as we work to reintegrate these areas back into the fold of the federal government."
 USB_demolish_guerillas: "Demolish Guerrillas"      
 USB_demolish_guerillas_desc: "Even though many of our enemies have been annihilated on the battlefield, there are those who still refuse to capitulate even in the face of destruction. Those who have failed to best us in open combat have either fled to remote areas or the urban underground in the hopes of thwarting our forces efforts to restore order - carrying out ambushes, acts of sabotage, and other desperate attempts at holding out against the inevitable. In addition to this, their irritating persistence stands as a half-hearted sign to the opposing population that the war is somehow not yet lost despite the very obvious lack of open warfare taking place. With these resistance efforts proving to be a thorn in our side, it is time that we ramp up the pressure; increased anti-guerilla operations will be put in effect, and sweeping attacks will be carried out on known resistance hotspots, effectively destroying their futile intent to bring about a late victory." 
 USB_end_the_traitors: "End The Traitors"
 USB_end_the_traitors_desc: "The Denver government's failure to uproot centuries of democratic political tradition has become their undoing. Having entered into this fight destined to experience the taste of unrelenting defeat at the hands of a proper military, many have turned tail and fled with every advancement we have made, with those who have not perished or surrendered having found themselves deep in our territory. Rather than making the sensible decision and recognizing that the war is likely over for them, they have foolishly decided to continue fighting against us - attacking garrisons, fortifications, and continuing to wait for relief that will likely never come. Regardless of their dedication to the wrong side, we have no use for strung-out enemy militias presiding in recently captured territory. Let's put an end to these stubborn holdouts."
 USB_engage_the_nsa: "Engage The NSA"
 USB_engage_the_nsa_desc: "If there's one aspect of wartime intelligentsia that has become especially crucial during this conflict, it would be knowing who the enemy is and what their patterns are. In cities and towns across the country, those with sympathies to radical groups and opposing governments remain ever-present and capable of subverting our efforts by offering aid to the very groups who seek nothing more than to destroy hundreds of years of sacred political tradition. Just as they did during the war on terror, the National Security Agency has been hard at work in their attempts to better track potential threats to the Union's citizens and our efforts to restore democracy nationwide, and with our recent progress it is time that they be given a greater role in carrying this task out. Public surveillance shall be increased, and more clandestine methods of acquiring information will once again be put in place in order to better sniff out those with plans to act against the government. Of course, those with nothing to hide will have nothing to fear from our protective gaze."
 USB_expand_the_fbi: "Expand The FBI"
 USB_expand_the_fbi_desc: "During the period leading up to the civil war, the Federal Bureau of Investigations quickly became one of the busiest and most active agencies in recent memory. With the breakout increase in terror bombings, shootings, targeted assassination attempts, and other politically-motivated acts of violence before, during, and after the election, it was rare to see an incident in which the Bureau was not present in its aftermath. The FBI has largely continued and adapted its duties throughout the war, seeing its new role not just to investigate federal crimes, but as federal police altogether - keeping the peace in sensitive areas alongside local authorities, and dealing with the enforcement of federal laws and directives. With their newfound applications, it is important that they receive the right amount of support as their area of operations continues to grow, especially with the sharp rise in criminal activity throughout the Union. It is only fitting that their funding be increased, ensuring that they have what they need to maintain law and order at home."
 USB_crush_the_rebels: "Crush The Rebels"
 USB_crush_the_rebels_desc: "As much as we hoped that this civil war would be limited to ourselves and the Trump government in the west, that has since turned out to be nothing more than wishful thinking. The fracturing of our society has permeated deep into the hearts and minds of millions of Americans, and many have turned away from democracy and towards radicalism and extremism. In the chaos of the initial collapse and the fighting that occurred within outlying regions, a number of the groups that saw newfound popularity before the war have managed to capture and occupy worrying amounts of territory. From secessionist rebels seeking to break away from the banner of the Union, to political radicals outright challenging our claim to national legitimacy, their presence as rogue elements on American soil is a crime in and of itself. With the stakes being clear as day to everyone involved, it is time that we snuff out these extremists and insurrectionists once and for all; we will present these upstarts with a single demand - stand down and disarm, or face military action. We're well prepared for the latter."
 USB_neutrality_is_complicity: "Neutrality Is Complicity"
 USB_neutrality_is_complicity_desc: "When the fighting erupted across the country, a number of state governments declared 'neutrality' in the fight between us and the Constitutionals, largely due to them being preoccupied with sweeping insurrections of their own. As it stands, many of these governments have been unfortunately overrun by the very groups they had attempted to crush in their infancy - leaving their officials dead or fleeing for their lives, with the age-old state and local authorities tumbling into dissolution at the hands of radical dissidents. Despite the task proving too difficult for many governors to handle, there still remains a number of outlying states and command centres that have managed to defeat or otherwise hold out against their respective enemies. In order to reconnect with isolated government officials, we must immediately begin contacting and sending out directives to the ones that still persist, and demand that they join forces under the banner of the Union once again. Although their hesitancy to commit to the rest of the nation was understandable at the time, there is no longer an excuse for fence-sitting in a time like this; they are either with us or against us."

 USB_crush_partisans: "Crush Partisans"
 USB_crush_partisans_desc: "To say that the average American's faith in the democratic system has been somewhat shaken would likely be the understatement of the century. While many people in recently freed areas are more than happy with the sight of government troops, this sentiment has unfortunately not been felt as strongly as we had hoped in other places, with protests in affected areas commonplace as many among the local population have loudly voiced their opposition to the Union throughout the war. Be they pro-Trump in nature or even in support of the radical factions we have recently liberated territory from, these vocal dissidents have been substantially disruptive to our efforts of reintegration, with the protests allowing for more subtle acts of resistance that in turn increase the need for garrison troops. To counter these attempts, an increased focus on dispersing and stamping out these troublesome individuals will be put forward; those without loyalty to the Union will no longer have their provocations tolerated in our streets, especially with the fate of American democracy at stake."
 USB_work_with_the_innovationists: "Work With The Innovationists"
 USB_work_with_the_innovationists_desc: "The Innovationists, while having always existed informally, have found themselves risen to a newfound congressional prominence as a result of our renewed commitments to cooperating with the business sector over the course of the civil war. Consisting of state experts, business enthusiasts, and those who see the benefits of an increased corporate role in American society, their presence has been quite beneficial in regards to matters of the economy and the measures taken towards reconstruction. With their influence now cemented in congress, it is but the natural course of action that we continue to work hand in hand with them for the good of the nation. Their insight regarding effective economic models and pragmatic public policy will once again make this country the prosperous golden beacon of opportunity it once was. Besides, it's best to leave things in the hands of those who know what they're doing."

 USB_concessions_to_companies_desc: "The Union's industrial complex is notably maintained by its benefactors, a large part of such being the federal government and where it decides to direct its monetary grants. As the corporate sectors continue to grow ever intertwined with the government apparatus as well as economic primacy, so has their need for increased amounts of government funding to account for their newly-expanding roles. Naturally, it is only reasonable that these requests be fulfilled - additional funds will be allocated for these companies, granting them additional means of carrying out whatever processes required to keep up their well-done services to the country. Not to mention, this measure will probably reciprocate towards those employed by these companies as well, as thanks for their commitment to a necessary workforce. We trust that they'll utilize their funds in the right places overall."
 USB_make_a_new_deal: "Synthesize The Nation"
 USB_make_a_new_deal_desc: "The key to a successful economy is a structure similar to a well-oiled machine. For many years, the United States's economy had been an wide-spanning and financially-heavy system of production, spurred on by the trends of the global market and well-intentioned business ventures. While we had done well to carry out this endeavor to great success, the main outlier in regards to the economy was the lack of coherency between different classes of citizens, with each group remaining quite distant from one another in terms of both cooperative efficiency and an understanding of their importance to the workforce. With the civil war leading us to utter economic ruin, a reorganization of the economy is needed; from the top-down, the various parts of the economy will be fused together, with the nation's top industrial experts and corporations leading the charge to achieve full class cooperation, comprised of an intricate system upheld by an active workforce and their equally diligent management. Together, we will work to make our country prosper yet again - with everyone involved benefitting in accordance with their importance and workload."
 USB_appoint_the_experts: "Appoint The Experts"
 USB_appoint_the_experts_desc: "In the midst of a civil war, one cannot afford to maintain an ineffective cabinet. Oftentimes, the people working in the executive are almost as important as the people who work under it, especially when it comes to disasters of such a high magnitude. In short, we need people who know  what they're doing; people with the much-needed expertise in fields such as finances, medicine, agriculture, production and other crucial positions best left to capable figures. With that in mind, we will begin the process of appointment for a number of high quality individuals with well-tenured backgrounds in their respective fields - scientists, researchers, economists, and experienced businessmen - to take the places of those deemed less adequate by the current administration. This change will allow for a much more effective process in governmental decision-making, with only the most dedicated and experienced individuals carrying out their role as public servants, rather than dull-headed yes-men and unflinching ideologues."
 USB_technocratic_reforms: "Technocratic Reforms"
 USB_technocratic_reforms_desc: "The initial bureaucratic and political chaos that was spurred as a result of the civil war's outbreak had, for a time, greatly hampered our efforts to maintain cohesion between the branches of government. With a large number of Republican congressional members and senators having jumped ship to commit treason, many seats in the House and the Senate were left entirely vacant, with the notion of elections to fill these seats being overshadowed due to more pressing matters. As these shortcomings of our existing systems continue to present themselves, the need for more practical applications of state has only grown more necessary as the war has dragged on. To fill the gaps and help the government run more proficiently, various changes will be made as to how the government will function, starting with the formation of various commissions and committees designed to address and manage a number of specific responsibilities of ranging varieties. Apart from a smoother administrative process, this measure will also make it much easier to appoint talented statesmen and legislators of varying backgrounds to replace the now-empty seats in congress and elsewhere."

 USB_economic_defense_act_desc: "Even with all of the progress we've made in rejuvenating the American economy and political system, there still remain those who seek to undermine it. Naive progressives and subversive socialists continue to cry out against only the most sensible of policy decisions, while simultaneously attempting to disrupt manufacturing efforts through the means of agitating for workers unions and collective protests. If we are to maintain productivity and protect the workforce against ideological trickery in this uncertain time, we must take definitive action to cement our policies. In the biggest legislative action yet for our economic growth, sweeping adjustments will be made to a number of meddlesome factors preventing more adequate financial successes. Various overbearing and unneeded workplace regulations will be significantly decreased or otherwise removed, allowing for an increase of employment positions and cut expenses for burdened employers. On a more fiscal note, however, the long-maintained and wasteful benefit programs for unemployed individuals will be massively scaled back in a manner that would have previously been unforseen just a few years ago. With this change, simply living off of government checks with no desire to work will no longer be tolerable or realistic for the vast majority of recipients, allowing for unemployment to reach new lows as the American work ethic becomes commonplace once more. Back to work, everybody!"

It would not be an exaggeration to state that to many people, this document remains one of, if not the most pivotal document in American history. While it is true that it maintains an incredibly important aspect of our government and the rights it entails, it is far from perfect - the troubles our nation has faced have exhibited a newfound need for a revision of our legal documents, a need that must not be put off any further. Though a tricky affair to engage in, we will begin the efforts necessary to formally state the importance of the nation's largest corporations and their vital roles in the country's economy and political framework. With their newfound recognition, their already valued input will finally be ratified into law - a monumental step towards greater prosperity for us all."

 USB_the_green_new_deal_desc: "In the past few years, climate-based activism has grown to reach one of the forefronts of American politics, with calls to act on and further the reduction of emissions having only gotten louder. As a result of an increasing public focus towards the wellbeing of the planet, a number of progressive politicians had endorsed and put forward the Green New Deal; a program designed to massively cut back on and eventually shut down numerous emission-heavy industries, while providing financial cover to those who would be affected by the transition to a much more green economy. Though such a costly endeavor had been ruthlessly opposed by most Republicans, the notable absence of a majority of those resisting its consideration has once again brought the proposal into the limelight. While some might criticize its implementation during wartime, the opportunity for real climate policy is too beneficial to pass up. This will be the first step in America's contribution to climate sustainability - and it is a step we will all take together."

 USB_the_second_great_society_desc: "The Great Society is perhaps one of America's greatest achivements. It provided aid to education, Medicare, urban renewal, conservation, development of depressed regions, a wide-scale fight against poverty, control and prevention of crime and delinquency, removal of obstacles to the right to vote. Yet many of those ideals are still applicable today. We have not recovered from the recession of 2020, with high unemployment rocking nearly every sector of our economy. Thus, rampant crime and poverty have taken hold of our cities, leading to a decrease in the quality of life for everyday americans. While Medicare is available for many, roughly 30 million americans still lack health insurance. Despite the Civil Rights Act of 1964, our country still has problems of voter representation, with over half the country being politically apathetic and not voting. Thus, the Second Great Society must make great strides to continue the legacy of the first - from the renewal of American cities and restoration of the rule of law, to the return of American Democracy."

We need to destroy the remnants of the past, plaguing America with their rhetoric. In safeguarding the sanctity of American democracy, our goal becomes clear: prevent the party, now associated with insurrectionists, from reclaiming a platform from which they can manipulate the sentiments of our people.

Now, the MIC has gotten far too large, and is bigger than itself. We need to tackle and diminish it in the aftermath of the Civil War before it gets too out of hand, after all, we have no need for such a relationship anyway. This allows us to reallocate resources invested into building it up, prevents overreliance on military solutions, avoids unnecessary defense programs, promotes fiscal responsibility, mitigates corruption, and promotes innovation in non-military sectors. A large military-industrial complex promotes worldwide intervention in armed conflicts, which contributed to our eventual collapse in the first place.

A proposed medicare policy, called "Medicare for All", posits that Obamacare did not go far enough and that we should implement a universal, single-payer healthcare system. Not only would this make healthcare a fundamental right rather than a privilege, it would be a cost-efficient method that re-organizes the fragmented and broken system. By streamlining the bureaucracy and negotiating bulk rates for services and medications, the overall cost of Medicare would be reduced, saving valuable money for both our citizens and the government.

Not a single person will be left behind, and we will ensure of that."
 USB_criminal_justice_reform: "Criminal Justice Reform"
 USB_criminal_justice_reform_desc: "With the destruction of the prison system across the United States, we now have the opportunity to address the systematic issues within our Criminal Justice system, and bring about comprehensive reforms. Mass incarceration is one of the most prolific issues within our prisons, and, despite it being diminished by prison breaks across the United States due to mass insurgency, we are quickly finding ourselves refilling the prison chambers across the United States. One central goal of criminal justice reform should be to reduce the disproportionately high rates of incarceration, mostly for nonviolent offenses. We should also promote rehabilitation, hold police officers accountable, invest in mental health programs, and building trust in the system. In a functioning democracy, there is no need for prisons akin to Soviet-ran gulags."

Many of our citizenries have been sluggishly apathetic to our war effort, unlike the constitutionalists who are currently drawing on their fanatic maga supporters to push against our relentless advances. We must immediately address the crisis by any means necessary to ensure that the people are fully supportive of our war effort. If we allow this crisis to fester, our war effort will be halted. And DC will be overrun by Constitutionalist forces."

This group of liberal Warhawks has been amongst the most passionate supporters both in terms of recruits and support for our government. Therefore, it is only natural that we support this growing movement in our party. Their support might determine whether we overrun Denver or the Constitutionalists overrun DC."
 USB_incorporate_new_recruits: "Incorporate New Recruits"
 USB_incorporate_new_recruits_desc: "While our new recruitment programs have succeeded in encouraging our citizens to enlist in mass this has presented us with a new problem.

For when they see what they have to lose, they will not think twice about joining the fight."

This movement is a threat to our war effort as this anti-American movement has manifested itself in the form of draft dodgers, protests, and strikes. We must take all measures necessary to discourage anti-Americanism and spur a sense of patriotism in our people, or the movement will be the death of our war effort."

While we have not fully embraced integration into the NATO high command we have made considerable efforts to integrate NATO doctrine into our military structure.

These social media platforms can be weaponized by us to spread anti-constitutionalist propaganda. In addition to spreading propaganda, we can use these online message sites to draw in potential recruits, domestic and foreign. However, we must also monitor these sites for content that is against our military campaign, as we cannot afford to allow the spread of pro-Constitutionalist rhetoric. If we allow this to happen, we will have to deal with new internal unrest and the ongoing war effort."

While Trump taps into his infinite pool of radical MAGA supporters we have been handed a population that is still semi-apathetic to the ongoing war. If we wish to maintain our offensive against the Constitutionalists drastic measures are needed to expand the pool of recruits. While the re-implementation of the draft will be controversial, it is necessary to counter the sheer size of Trump's army."

The Constitutionalists have access to a near-infinite pool of volunteers mainly from their radical MAGA supporters. While we have been mostly able to deal with these poorly trained militia it has caused our advance to slow significantly. To combat this issue we authorized the implementation of Shock and Awe warfare and have deployed additional units of air and armor to break militia assaults. While there is the fear that this strategy will cause unnecessary death and destruction it is the best way to blunt the constant MAGA assaults and raids. "

Much of our population remains defiant of the draft we have instituted, with many protesting against this or attempting to evade being drafted. We cannot allow this movement to gain momentum and must take any measure necessary to ensure the practice stops entirely. Should we falter in our attempts to subvert this practice, the consequences will be severe, and our campaign against Trump will fail."

However, the nation is divided - and so, now, is that same force of peace. The upper command, in personal communication with the President, is in one mind and fully cooperative with him. The rank and file, on the other hand, completely opposes the agenda of the current President. The difficulty in maintaining a cohesive military is nearing critical, with desertion commonplace and the loyal soldiers the commanders are used to ordering around becoming harder and harder to find."

Despite the collapse of the economy and supply chains for much of the necessary functions of our nation, communities have banded together, intent on weathering the storm.\n\n\nAs this civil war drags on, more extreme factions may gain traction throughout our nation.

Having deeply coordinated with the USAF in the time Biden held the Vice President chair, most of the US air forces find themselves indebted to Biden for their careers. Needless to say, when the Civil War began, most of the USAF stayed loyal to the rightful administration - and now we find ourselves in dominance of the skies of the land of Freedom."

In the rural countryside, many pro-trump militia lie in wait, ambushing unsuspecting federal convoys on their way to supply the troops in the midwest. In the center of this planned insurgency, is West Virginia, whose mountainous terrain is perfect for this type of treason. \n\nSecuring control of West Virginia is crucial to the war effort, with its location in the middle of the Washington-Chicago corridor serving as an important throughpoint for supplies heading to the frontlines."

Betrayal runs deep in the American lifeblood, as it was the very foundation of America that was built upon the betrayal of the King. When America was founded, the people trusted not the government, but her elected officials to do what was best for the citizenry and for the country. As time passed and money seeped its way into the roots of the Tree of Liberty, her branches withered, and her branches bore only poison.  \n\nWe, the true inheritors of America, have seen many different varieties of corrupt traitor and we have bested them all, and now, we shall judge them on their sins."

 usb.1.t: "Joe Biden has Died"
 usb.1.desc: "Today, the 46th President of the United States of America, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, has passed away.\n\nTo many, it was considered inevitable - yet it does not make the outcome less difficult to grasp. Despite countless months of the president persevering through the massive weight of America's future on his shoulders, his toughness and persistence in the face of tyranny was not enough to remedy his ailing health. Few could ever imagine the stress that the president carried with him as a result of this devastating conflict - stress that many believe was ultimately the leading cause of his gradual health decline and eventual death. A state of mourning has occurred across the Union as the news has begun to reach external sources; our flags fly at half-mast as condolences have begun to arrive from foreign nations.\n\nAs necessary for when a president passes away while in office, Vice President Kamala Harris was near-immediately sworn in as Biden's successor, formally becoming the 47th president of the United States. While this would ordinarily be regarded as a monumental occasion for the fact that she is now the nation's first ever African-American and Asian woman to hold the office of the presidency, both herself and everyone else can agree that this progress did not come about as they had hoped it would. Regardless, the responsibility of leading the country to victory has now fallen upon President Harris, whom many are convinced will last long enough to see the war's end due to her vastly younger age and generally better health."

 usb.2.desc: "During a recent congressional session in D.C, the §GProgressives§! within the Congress have proposed legislation regarding our current social expenditures. The bill calls for increased funding towards social programs and relief efforts for Americans suffering the effects of the war, particularly in an effort to keep Americans afloat during this terrible time. The §GProgressives§! cite the need to \"bear in mind the health and wellbeing of our citizens, now more than ever\".While some §YLiberals§! have agreed with this notion, the bill comes at the behest of §CConservatives§!, who believe such a bill to be \"wasteful spending\" during a time as dire as this, believing that such funds would be better spent elsewhere. Regardless of opinion, it is up to the President to pass or veto this legislation."
 usb.2.a: "They need our help more than ever, right now. (Pass The Bill)"
 usb.2.b: "We don't need to expand what doesn't need expanding. (Veto The Bill)"
 usb.3.t: "§YLiberals§! Propose Military Spending Bill"
 usb.3.desc: "During a recent congressional session in D.C, the Democratic representatives have proposed legislation regarding our current expenditures. The bill calls for an increase of funding towards our armed forces and infrastructure, citing our current situation to require additional focus on our military's combative abilities in order to \"ensure that the defenders of American citizens and democracy are adequately equipped in the face of tyrannical adversity\". With the war raging onwards, the proposal is considered to be a reasonable action due to present circumstance.\n\nWhile a number of §CConservatives§! have expressed approval in the proposal, several §GProgressives§! have shown some concern regarding the bill, believing that focusing on the armed forces too intensively will result in the neglect of those citizens most affected by the war. Regardless of opinion, the decision to pass or veto the bill is up to the President."
 usb.3.a: "The military needs the funding now more than ever. (Pass The Bill)"
 usb.3.b: "The state of our military is fine, for now. (Veto The Bill)"
 usb.4.t: "§CConservatives§! Propose Spending Reduction"
 usb.4.desc: "During a recent congressional session in D.C, the Republican representatives have proposed legislation regarding the current status of our domestic expenditures. The bill itself calls for a reduction in social spending across the board, citing our current situation to be dire enough for the public to \"undertake necessary sacrifices\" on a financial level for the good of America's future, intending to free up funding for more immediately required expenditures aimed at assisting the current war effort.\n\nApproving of such legislation will no doubt be amidst the disapproval of congress's §YLiberal§! and §GProgressives§! members, as it actively works to usurp bils that they have passed in the recent sessions. Many balk at the idea that we make cuts to such amenities in a time when many Americans have found themselves downtrodden and unstable in their financial situations. Regardless of opinions, it is the President's decision whether to pass or veto the bill."

Many cite the risk we put the world at by through mass re-industrialization, citing Climate Change studies as proof that we need to stop industrializing. Regardless of opinions, it is the President's decision whether to pass or veto the bill."

 usb.5.desc: "With the civil war continuing to rage on, basic functions of society continue to slowly crumble. Despite our best efforts, we find it harder to provide for our people and enforce our laws on the streets of our nation. Regular citizens resort to violence and crime to keep afloat while the worst of our society take advantage of each other more and more. Conflict between ideological enemies leaves our towns in ruins that we cannot fix fast enough, and the mood becomes more sombre by the day.\n\nWe must divert resources towards tackling the sources of such unrest, before we find ourselves neck deep in chaos."

 usb.6.t: "Joe Biden's Health Decreases"
 usb.6.desc: "With the weight of the second American civil war upon the commander-in-chief's shoulders, the state of President Biden's health has nonetheless taken a hit as of late. With such tremendous stress placed upon the 46th president of the United States, the effects of this conflict have begun to present themselves in his everyday tasks. As of recently, the president has begun to complain about experienced headaches and migraines, in addition to increased amounts of physical fatigue and dizziness as a result.\n\nWhile nothing to really worry about at the moment, the president's age as well as the gravity of this war is expected to only worsen his condition as things continue."
 usb.6.a: "A little bit of stress is nothing to fuss about."
 usb.7.t: "Corporate Influence Increases"
 usb.7.desc: "With the various corporations and large industries dutifully serving the rightful American government, it is no secret that their presence has intensified. Be it providing aid relief to affected areas in tandem with government forces, providing government-friendly media reports on both the progress of the war as well as domestic news, supplying our troops with equipment, and even much-needed supply runs to the frontline, the increased presence of the biggest economic competitors - both within the military industrial complex and outside of it - have contributed greatly to our efforts thus far.\n\nWhile few can deny the benefits, they have conversely been gaining a considerable amount of influence as of late. More pro-corporate legislation has been passed and proposed, citing their charitability and direct assistance during the war - however, some speculate this is due to past and present connections to the various companies currently making the rounds. Regardless, we will have to keep an eye on these internal developments, lest something drastic occurs as a result of the country's now-weakened political structure."

 usb.12.t: "The Corporate Plot"
 usb.12.desc: "It was no secret within the inner-workings of the Union political machine that over the course of the war, a number of highly prominent businesses and conglomerates have gained what looks to be an extremely high amount of influence within the government. President Biden was likewise well-aware of this - which is precisely what raised his suspicion when he received a call for a meeting regarding future policy by various figures one would consider ''influential''. \n\nOrdinarily, he wouldn't have thought twice about it. Meetings were a common occurrence with his position. When he received that call, however, he felt as if something had changed - he could almost sense a difference in their tone, as if the invitation for the meeting wasn't intended to discuss \"future policies\" at all. Such a suspicious atmosphere had become much more prevalent as of late. Perhaps he had gotten wiser with age - or, conversely, more paranoid - but he couldn't shake the feeling that accepting the invitation to this meeting would lead to something unprecedented.\n\nThe clock in the oval office ticked onward, the seconds passing by. The time reminded him that a congressional session was currently underway, regarding a topic he had since forgotten about. From here, a decision was to be made - one that would undoubtedly determine the future of the Union, whether the president wished it to be true or not."
 usb.12.a: "\"Send my aides to the meeting. I'd like a word with Congress.\""
 usb.12.b: "\"I'll be there.\""
 usb.13.t: "Joe Biden's Health Decreases"
 usb.13.desc: "With the conflict raging onwards, President Joe Biden's health has continued to deteriorate over the last few weeks. Regularly, the commander-in-chief has been undergoing considerable chest and muscle pain throughout his body, his joints having grown rather stiff due to the high levels of discomfort. In several cases in which he has overexerted himself, he has noted significant pains in his chest, finding himself keeled over more often and generally not at the level as he was when his term first began.\n\nNaturally, the news of chest pains coming from a man as old as the president aroused some alarm in his cabinet and medical staff. A checkup concluded that the changes were, as of now, nothing to be alarmed about - that it was primarily stress and old age getting to him, and not any underlying condition. On top of his prior symptoms, however, this has arrived at no shortage of discomfort for the president."
 usb.13.a: "Concerning."
 usb.14.t: "Joe Biden's Health Decreases"
 usb.14.desc: "As of late, it has become highly apparent to the president's staffers and cabinet that his health has taken a turn for the worse. In recent days, the president has been stricken with illness, showing signs of feverish symptoms and an increased difficulty with everyday tasks, to the point where he has required aid several times over. His pale complexion and general physical weakness have been accompanied with vomiting, disorientation, and a lack of a desire to eat much of anything.\n\nAs such, there are now a number of medical staff kept close to President Biden, in order to ensure his continued treatment as he carries out his duties despite the increased difficulty of doing so. While the President claims that it's nothing more than a seasonal flu affecting him, few within his staff believe that's the only factor."
 usb.14.a: "We need to keep a very close eye on him, now."
 usb.15.t: "Joe Biden's Health Decreases"
 usb.15.desc: "It is obvious to many within Biden's inner circle that there is something clearly very wrong with the state of his health. The immense pressure of the civil war has, for quite some time now, worn down the commander-in-chief's physical and mental ability. While having once been able to more or less deal with the discomfort, the president has now found himself to be bedridden much more than normal. Medical staff aid his movements to ensure he does not somehow fall and cause a fracture; he is constantly hooked up to an IV in order to keep him hydrated. Despite all of this, the president remains adamant that he remain present at the various meetings and discussions - even though a good number of his duties have largely been carried out by his staffers and Vice President Harris in his stead.\n\nWhile still remaining somewhat active in decision-making, the president's cognitive ability - something that was of question even before the civil war, albeit mostly based around attacks from opposition - has very obviously faltered tremendously as well. A number of instances in which Biden has forgotten things previously well-known (be they names, faces, directions, and so forth) as well as confusion regarding past discussions and meetings have been very much noticed by those around him. Rumors in the Capitol and the White House continue to float around, with the general atmosphere being a sense of dread for the 46th president."
 usb.15.a: "He doesn't have much time left, does he?"
 usb.16.t: "The Room has Closed"
 usb.16.desc: "\"It is within these values that we find ourselves with a delicate balance of power - both in terms of the executive, and the functioning of the state apparatus,\" the President spoke with an uncomforting amount of focus, as if to cut the House of Representatives with only his gaze. The atmosphere of the room shifted, what was once awe and confusion towards the dull and often ignored president, slowly became an awareness of how extensive president's knowledge was. \n\n\"As our nation goes through what is arguably its darkest period in over two-hundred years,\" he continued, \"it is paramount that we bear in mind the reasons for why this regrettable conflict is being fought. There is nothing more important,\" he paused briefly as the doors to the chamber opened a bit forcefully, as several notable figures - congressmen, remaining business leaders, top officials - stopped in their tracks at the sight of the commander-in-chief at the top podium. As the President paused and looked at the entrance, it caused a few nearby representatives to turn and look with raised eyebrows at the men who had just barged in.\n\n\"...Than preserving our democracy from any and all forces, foreign and domestic,\" he finished, looking right at the men of note. They awkwardly adjusted their attire as they attempted to casually find their seats as if they had intended to be part of the session beforehand. Those who did not belong gave awkward nods and filtered out of the chamber, no doubt fuming at their seemingly easy objective had been so embarrassingly and easily thwarted. Even a few already attending the session shifted awkwardly in their seats, more or less aware of what had nearly happened. The President gave a brief smirk from the corner of his mouth, and continued to deliver his speech - unconcerned about what would occur when he left the room."
 usb.16.a: "Powerful speech, Mr. President."
 usb.16.a: "Ambition can be bought..."
 usb.17.t: "Biden's Resignation"
 usb.17.desc: "As of today, the 46th President of the United States, Joseph Robinette Biden, has resigned his position amidst a number of professed reasons and factors. Instances of his own personal health decline, growing opposition in the House of Representatives, and a lack of confidence in the Commander-in-Chief has led to the President's ultimate stepping down from power, reportedly of his own accord.\n\nThis sudden decision has led to the ruffling of some feathers in Congress, with some condemning the President's action, stating that it has harmed national unity in a time when the country needed a leader the most. Others commend the President's resignation, respecting the President's concluding that he was no longer fit to lead the nation rather than possibly lead it into ruin and defeat during this difficult time.\n\nDespite the long tradition of the Vice-President taking up the position, a brief emergency session in the House has resulted in an unprecedented occurrence, in which many members of congress proposed former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg - who had retained his influence throughout the war - for the office of the Presidency, citing his past political experience and his in-tune behavior with many of the Union's apparatuses of state. While many have balked at this move, Vice-President Kamala Harris has endorsed Bloomberg's sudden ascension to the highest office in the nation, and will purportedly remain in her position."
 usb.17.a: "\"Gentlemen, everything's paid and accounted for.\""
 usb.18.t: "The Corporate Plot Thickens"
 usb.18.desc: "As what was undoubtedly the most consequential political disaster of the 21st century continued to unfold across America, the machinations of the once powerful political machine had needless to say become considerably shifted in responsibility. As seen in recent months, the influence of corporations within the Union had, despite the best efforts of the Chief-of-Staff to keep them under control, had only continued to grow and expand in the face of the war.\n\nIt was no secret that the war had brought higher ambitions from those in high standing with the state apparatus. Previous attempts to make more direct political maneuvers against the executive had been subtly thwarted, thanks to the unusually quick thinking of the President. Despite recent successes in curbing the influence of internal elements, it appears that their recent stagnation hasn't deterred any would-be plotters as much as we had initially hoped. A number of congress members and influential businessmen have grown considerably more suspicious in their actions after a period of perceived subtlety; notable gatherings, curious meetings and phone calls, and a lowbrow effort to further corporate efforts on the policy stage have all been observed in recent months.\n\nThis sudden increase in odd activity has, of course, not gone unnoticed by the President. It appears that after their previous shortcomings, the assumed plotters - if still actively seeking to usurp the President's authority - have been preparing for quite some time now. As such, the President is faced with a decision that he had hoped not to have undertaken again during his tenure in office. He could instruct his intelligence brass to investigate these persons of interest, throwing them off track once they realize that the Commander-in-Chief has a bead on them once more; or, he could hold off on any further internal observation. After all, for all he knew they weren't plotting anything underhanded whatsoever - but was it really worth the risk if they had already tried once?"

 usb.18.b: "\"No need to ruffle any feathers over paranoia.\""
 usb.19.t: "Embracing The Board"
 usb.19.desc: "Bloomberg shuffled onto the Congressional floor, surrounded by his staffers as well as several politicians trailing behind him. Everyone in that room knew this would be one of the most crucial Congressional meetings in recent American history; the crux of the midterm's aftermath, this would be the deciding vote on the new majority leader. Economic mismanagement, public instability, and disjointed leadership had proven disastrous for the Liberal Caucus. Figureheaded by Kamala Harris, they had been the most influential force within the internal politics of the new Union, and this would be the climax of their downfall. The presiding official announced that the vote would commence without much deliberation by Kamala, wracked with nervousness as her staffers watched intently.\n\nThe \"business plot\". That's what disillusioned Liberals and Progressives alike would go on to call this moment. The last vote was cast by Senator Michael Bennet, in favor of the Innovationist caucus. The vote resulted in a turnout of 61-39, with the hurriedly formed Progressive-Liberal Caucus failing to strike down a combined Conservative and Innovationist effort to inaugurate Al Gore as majority leader. Gore strode up the podium stairs, having been passed the floor by the presiding official.\n\n\"My fellow Americans, I am here to speak with the utmost gratitude on this resolution. American Democracy is under attack on every front, internally and externally. A new America needs action more than anything else, and, under constitutional Oath, I swear that man will be me.\""

Sure, multiple blows struck the very core of a man tied together by struggle, but he knew: Once you get knocked out, you get right up again. He slowly got up out of the need to truly see what he had sought for his entire presidency, walking to each echelon of the Truman Balcony and watching as the sun shimmered onto the hearts of Americans going back to work or simply enjoying the moment. In the midst of it, he took out the \"Ulysses\" by James Joyce, an inspiration to him and the personal copy that got him through the very hell in the first half, and read: \"You can't bring back time.

A convoy of army trucks and MRAPs would cruise through 14th Street without prior warning to the residents, similar to the ones seen on televised frontlines and social media. No prior warning was given to the residents, and, on that particular morning, there was an incredibly important Senatorial meeting only miles south of the Heights. Most assumed they had been dispatched due to an internal threat or to guard the meeting, though this had never happened before. The real whiplash came when dozens of National Guardsmen stepped out of their doors and started closing down shops and imposing curfews, AR-15s in hand, with the city practically being locked down. This was followed by a complete blackout, spurring nothing but panic for D.C. residents.\n\nRows upon rows of trucks filled the streets surrounding the Capitol Building, with police officers defending the Capitol being given immediate orders to surrender. The capitol was locked down from all sides and was stormed by a train of guardsmen, soldiers, and Special Forces operatives acting as entourages for a cabal of senior officers decorated shoulder to shoulder in medals. The lower floors of the Capitol were swept, with reports coming in that the White House was surrounded as well. The cortège of soldiers and officers broke through the Senate Hall, abruptly ending the session with the swinging of a few rifles.\n\n\"What's going on here?!\"\n\"What's the meaning of-?!\"\n\n The cry of many a Senator did not deter the men from carrying out what they perceived to be their Constitutional duty, with the leading officer reading from a document.\n\n\"We are carrying out executive duties. The President has announced a declaratory surrender under the jurisdiction of wartime provisions. We are here to enforce the establishment of a provisional administration to oversee the formation of a new Government. Senator Michael Bloomberg will be sworn in as President of the United States of America, as so valiantly he has fought threats to our Democracy both externally and internally. This Senate meeting is adjourned.\" The officer announced to the locked down Senate floor from the podium, with the presiding official being dismissed."

No longer shall outdated partisan systems such as gerrymandering and first past the post voting hide the true will of the American people and allow the billionaires on Wall Street to control our elections. With the new electoral systems in place - most notably ranked-choice voting, publically funded elections, the dissolution of the 2 party system through various legal mechanisms and multiple rounds of voting, the Democratic Socialists of America have emerged as a clear winner and formed a majority coalition government alongside the Greens and Socialist Alternative, with the Democrats, Libertarians and the newly formed Patriotic People's Party in opposition.\n\nUnfortunately due to the unstable situation of the nation, a majority of the country was unable to vote due to areas being held by guerillas and insurrectionists that seek to destroy our democracy. In addition, many states under military administration have not been formally reintroduced into the Union after their secession, making it so much of the midwest was unrepresented. Nevertheless, the success of democracy in the territories that have been loyal to the Union of America has been a great testament to our new system, and proof that our democracy will emerge from this civil war stronger than it was before."

These organizations were armed and trained by West Virginia National Guard units following our arrival in D.C., and these units have now entrenched across the countryside, especially within the Appalachian mountainrange, distributing guns to local fighters. Intelligence briefings have also pointed out the construction of makeshift fortifications, pillboxes, bunkers, and even improvised fighting vehicles using whatever scraps they could find. \n\nWe mustn't make haste, and we should begin preparing for immediate military action in the region to secure our democracy from internal threats and prevent this situation from getting out of control. Already, several counter-insurgency brigades have been called up to handle this, and we are engaging in a policy of encirclement, using superior firepower to tighten the noose around the neck of the insurgency and wait for them to run out of equipment, demoralizing them with shock and awe campaigns in the air. Despite these concepts seeming promising, it is sure to cost us valuable time and effort, diverting our attention away from the frontline. We should also begin forming connections with collaborators and those loyal to the legitimate government, primarily in urban areas, allowing us to infiltrate the insurgency and destroy it from the inside.

This insurgency had been a thorn in our side, striking supply lines and railway networks leading to the frontline in the Midwest. They had also diverted serious effort and resources from the frontlines in the West, allowing for the \"Constitutionalist\" traitors to halt our advance. Reports also detail the destruction of over 50 terrorist cells in West Virginia in recent offensives by specialized counter-insurgency brigades, paralyzing any potential enemy action in the region for the time being and securing local interests. This is also a huge propaganda victory, as our troops are shown to be the most refined and specially trained in the world for these types of operations, and that no matter what the egomaniac in Denver does, our democracy will remain firm.\n\nPrecisely executed operations, such as the assassination of insurgency leaders hiding in the region, as well as the encirclement and destruction of insurgent brigades utilizing superior firepower, have shattered their resistance. The suppression of this insurgency allows for a significant reallocation of our military resources, as counter-insurgent brigades previously engaged in the Appalachians are freed up to reinforce the frontlines against the broader threat westwards. We should begin efforts to rebuild local infrastructure to win over local hearts and minds, preventing any seditious ideologies from resurging. There should also remain a strong presence in the region, and as such, an executive order maintaining Martial Law has been extended, giving us more time to clear hideouts, trial the traitors, and ensure lasting stability.

Recent reports indicate that a diverse array of insurgent cells scattered across our territory have been effectively infiltrated, encircled, and dismantled through precisely executed surgical operations targeting key insurgency leaders, aswell as depriving remnant cells of crucial equipment in the area. This victory has allowed us to reconsolidate several brigades that were previously caught up in engagements against these subversive elements, redirecting our focus to the frontlines where the bulk of Trump's band of traitors fight on. Trump and the cabal of traitors in Denver have announced their support for this insurgency which had started on the eve of the Civil War, and has been arming them through smuggling rings ever since. This is also a great propaganda victory, and we have publicized our efforts and Trump's willingness to kill more Americans across the country.\n\nIn the wake of this monumental victory, however, it remains crucial that we maintain a strong presence in the Appalachians and states infested with insurgents. Remaining vigilant is key as we prepare for potential counterattacks and ambushes from remnants of the defeated insurgency. As the saying goes, you can never be too cautious with a snake, even after you've managed to kick it down. While these campaigns have undeniably bolstered morale among our troops on the ground and those on the home-front, we should continue campaigns to root out these partisan bases rigorously wherever and whenever they appear; insurgent leaders who slipped through our grasps are sure to mount a counteroffensive, and recklessly ramming some of the most elite portions of our counter-insurgency forces into an uphill, forested and fortified area will do us no good."

Despite our efforts, reports indicate that the network of insurgent cells across our territory has proven resilient, with a large counteroffensive by insurgents leading to swaths of territory lost and their presence in the area growing increasingly stronger. The failure of these operations hampers our efforts on the frontlines against Trump's gaggle of traitors, as the insurgency continues to resist, causing the needless death of more American soldiers. It is now crucial to maintain a larger presence in insurgent-infested areas, organize a withdrawal from areas deemed untenable to hold to minimize casualties, and prepare another counter-assault to destroy traitor holdouts.\n\nThese setbacks have cast a shadow on morale, and have raised concerns amongst our High Command regarding the quality of counter-insurgency operatives. We should begin re-assessing counter-insurgency techniques, intensify training, and begin reassigning officers and unit leaders deemed responsible for the failure. In the meantime, our current prerogative should be to limit the extent of insurgent control in these regions and begin fortifying local settlements to try and encircle them, launching vigorous campaigns to bleed them dry of resources and support amongst the local populace. While we are back on the drawing board, we must assure our men on the ground that we may have lost a battle, but this war is far from over."

Their precise intentions and strategies remain unknown, yet their overall efforts to subvert our national security demand decisive action. \n\nThese groups are not only a threat to our immediate safety but also symbolic of a larger, orchestrated effort by the previous administration and their allies to destabilize our nation.

Romney has campaigned on a mixture of Reaganesque optimism and Neoconservative hawkishness,  launching stringent broadsides against Trumpism while also promising tax cuts once the war is over.

 usb.521.d: "Joseph R. Biden, the man who secured a unanimous nomination from the Union's coalition without any debate, has truly surpassed expectations today. Following his nomination, Biden delivered a presidential address that can only be described as historic. His speech, infused with energy and optimism, presented a vision for a brighter future that resonated deeply with listeners. The initial part of his address was filled with fervent promises and an invigorating sense of possibility, setting a tone of joy and excitement. As the speech progressed, however, Biden shifted his approach to address the more sobering realities facing the nation. He spoke with a measured tone about the ongoing hardships and the persistent struggle for peace and stability that many Americans continue to endure. This pivot had demonstrated his awareness of the current challenges and his commitment to confronting them head-on.\n\nThe reaction to Biden's address has been nothing short of overwhelming. What began as a jubilant rallying cry has evolved into a powerful statement that has reverberated across the Union and throughout America. Despite facing a dip in approval ratings, Biden's address has sparked a renewed sense of hope among the populace. It is evident that, with this speech, Joseph R. Biden has cemented his position not just as a leader, but as a symbol of enduring hope and resilience. His presidency appears to be solidifying, and his message has invigorated the nation with a sense of optimism for the future."

 usb.522.d: "Despite a mixture of optimism and dread from the eve of the President's address to the nation, it turned out to be quite the mix of a sudden, but satisfactory, conclusion. As he spoke to the nation, he came off as an ordinary wartime President, well understood and critical of the situation, whilst making minor stumbles and errors once pronouncing certain phrases or words as a whole. However, to the American public, it is simply a commonality with President Biden, a scrappy; but understandable and considerate man who has taken the grasp of the situation. \n\nThe reaction has been met with a mixed result among the coalition government, a balance of praise and slight disgruntled opposition among conservatives and progressives alike, but it has proven Biden isn't as fragmented as many seemed to believe."

 usb.524.t: "Administrative Fallout!"
 usb.524.d: "In an event predictable to many after the failure of his address, dozens if not hundreds of local state senators and representatives to full on congressional members from all portions of the government, Conservative or Progressive, have officially left the entirety of the coalition government under the helm of President Joe Biden. What was supposed to be simple walk outs by minor segments of state governments, turned into a full complete shutdown of the coalition as a whole, with the mainstream echelons of each branch denouncing Biden for his failure to comply with the situation ongoing in the eve of America's civil war and lacking awareness for how serious and dire the environment for the nation is. \n\nThis has led for a full on emergency within the Biden Administration, as cabinet members from all departments and remnant loyalists of the Democratic Party begin to prepare a response to save what remains of unity in the face of a potential government disaster. President Biden has reacted with shock and ramped up attacks to no avail, as he is given the hand by a now disgruntled Union. This could begin the very demise of the Biden Presidency and a true blow to Unionist efforts."
 usb.524.a: "Blown it all to Hell!"
 usb.523.t: "A Man, now Shattered"
 usb.523.d: "On the eve of doubt, this moment was supposed to cement the President as a beacon of strength in the face of such adversity, and to dash away the doubts of suspicion about the strength of Biden's control within the Oval Office.  Yet, in the face of horror for most Democrats and those who climbed onto hope for the survival of any sort of coalition, the address has been considered a total disaster for President Joe Biden. \n\nDespite the attempt to project himself as a champion within the ultimate American recovery story in the face of rebellious opposition and tyranny internally, at the threat of a tinpot dictator, he has only sunk a deeper hole in saving his administration, from stuttering to full on collapse in wording or judgment, turning into a complete gaffe show. \nDamage control may no longer be a viable option for the President and his cabinet, as internal strife only emboldens to chain the President at hand, signaling the complete failure of his control and previous competency."

 usb.525.d: "Many thought it was impossible; a frail, slowly decaying man like Joe Biden to win such a pressuring debate of policy and excellency. Yet, even when the pressure of Romney and Sanders, their fiery language being a token to Biden's gesture of determination, he simply fought back, excreting a little bit of debate magic he had left within him, refuting points and tossing them like trash, eye popping moments caught on live coverage, all with his so called ''well minded and sharp'' opponents on stage being dashed into silence. People are describing it as a ''nationwide'' comeback for good ol' Joe, taking an aim similar to Lincoln in the wake of 1864, predicting for him to fallout with national players, only for a major event to turn the tide. Polling data already confirms that Biden is sure to gain a steady lead from an amazing performance."

 usb.526.t: "''Crazy Uncle'' Joe"
 usb.526.d: "The Union watched as the debate quickly sorrowed into an unprecedented cesspool of consistent nagging and deliberate, unprovoked attacks waged across the board. Yet, in the middle of such a sea of gray and bitter tension, eyes turned to a once mighty, steady and strengthened debater, who used to never allow himself to be unheard or silenced by the beat of someone, only to freeze up in the midst of a high stakes event, or act like a charged up, elder family member, spewing phrases that had no substance within what was supposed to be a professional and civilized manner, a far cry in comparison to 2020. That man is the sitting President, Joe Biden. To put it clear; this was a major blunder among the campaign of the sitting administration, making it clear of cracks soon to follow, and likely pushing the fiery ball of political surrender right back into Biden's court, and it is only continuing to build a mounting pressure. "
 usb.526.a: "A shell of his former self."
 usb.527.t: "Memories of 2016"
 usb.527.d: "Sanders stood at the podium, his eyes gleaming with the fire of decades of political passion. This debate wasn't just another political sparring match for him; it was the culmination of a lifetime dedicated to progressive ideals. In 2016, he had watched as his message was sidelined, his supporters disillusioned. Now, in 2024, the political landscape had shifted, and the nation seemed ready to truly hear him. As Biden fumbled through his responses, clearly struggling with the rapid-fire nature of the debate, Sanders found himself transported back to his youth, to the civil rights movements and labor struggles that had shaped his worldview. Each question became an opportunity not just to outline policy, but to paint a vision of the America he had always fought for. The senator's voice, usually gruff and insistent, took on a new timbre. It resonated with the urgency of a man who knew this might be his last chance to reshape the nation's trajectory. His hands, weathered by years of gesticulating at rallies and in the Senate, moved with precision, emphasizing each point with the gravity it deserved."
 usb.527.a: "Progressivism is Back Baby!"
 usb.528.t: "2012 Avenged"
 usb.528.d: "Romney was a man built on compassion and respect, as most pundits and spectators of the debate proceeded to label him, yet; the debate had a personal meaning to him. In 2012, Paul Ryan, his running mate for the older and true wing of the Republican Party, was slaughtered by Joe in another coordinated debate during the midst of the election cycle, being barely able to get a word out in the wake of such a comprehensive election cycle. Now, the tables have been turned; now the aging and declining Biden is the one unable to properly spew out his phrases, whilst the more elegant and relaxed Romney proceeded to dash out fiery blows to the staggered and defeated President. This personal avenging of his disaster within 2012 was simply euphoric, as it is now the destiny of Romney to achieve America's story, no longer the chains of a man lacking a proper backbone within the party. The polling effect has been noted to be a major swing, with the disastrous performance of Biden already being put into a clean up crew, sweeping away the bits and pieces of fractured and broken glass being the result of the debate."

Thirty-eight artillery missions in one day, each one trying to halt the Unionist advance on Denver and the plains surrounding the city. Each one had a story to tell their grandchildren if they survived this war.\n\nJohn took a drag of his cigarette, blowing out the smoke as he looked at their relatively new M224 mortar. The one they had previously was destroyed during the battle of Omaha, it got blown up when an A-10 Warthog strafed their position. John laughed at the thought, that day had been the punchline of so many jokes he and his team made, about how Ben shit himself when he heard the A-10, and how Abner accidentally swallowed his cigarette during the strafe. The reminiscing brought John to his past, he remembered the days when his family moved from Moldova to America in 2003 when he was two, how he changed his first name from Artyom to John but kept his last name. He remembered his first day of school, the rest of his childhood and teenage years, and finally his adult days.\n\nHe started tearing up while reminiscing, water slowly filling the bottom of his eyes. He wiped away the tears and took another puff of his cigarette, then handed it to Ben when he asked for a puff. He looked up into the sky, it was night time, however, he could still hear the light pangs of far-away gunfire, and then the louder thumps as artillery cracked the ground beneath it. The noises had become a song for John. Without it, he didn't feel comfortable.\n\nEventually, he was taken out of his stupor as he heard the familiar drone of... well a drone. Frantically, he told his team about the noise, and in a few moments, he could only hear yelling as people ran to take shelter. The drone's noise grew closer. When it finally hit their encampment, it struck a fuel tank on the mortar team's truck, igniting it, and sending fire everywhere. John wasn't lucky as he was caught in the inferno, his last few moments were a stark contrast to the calm happening a few moments ago."

Utilizing his already existing supporter base, Sander's campaign trail went off amazingly, gaining a huge amount of new supporters from the Liberals and Progressives alike, only facing harsh resistance from the Conservatives. It was this campaigning and supporter base that won him the election with a comfortable majority. Sanders would find himself at peace during the months before his inauguration, and despite the fact of the current situation in America, Sanders would find himself not nervous of his upcoming role, but more determined than ever. \n\nAnd so he stood on the podium of the National Mall, gazing across the crowd in front of him with a light smile on his face. It had all led up to this moment, his whole life he had wanted something like this, and even though the situation at hand wouldn't have been what a young Sanders would've preferred, it was what he was getting.

Having familiarized himself with some of the political figures within the Union, he quickly garnered a stable political position. It was when the idea of a second chance for president became too tempting for him, that he threw in his hat for the presidential race, where he was able to establish a good supporter base between Liberals and Progressives alike, facing major resistance from the Conservatives. His relatively young age, broad supporter base, and new ideas led him to his electoral victory. And while it was hard fought, Yang had accomplished his dream, even if it was his second try. \n\nHe stood at the podium of the National Mall, however, not with a feeling of joy and pride, but seriousness. The job ahead of him would be stressful, but he wouldn't back down, he would realize his dream in full. He shed a small tear before quickly wiping it away, a president would have to be resilient in the face of anything, and he would be no exception. He pocketed his tissue and began his speech."

When the civil war broke out, it was no different, Bloomberg fled to the Union and began offering his services to the government there, earning more power in the government over time. His experience as an economic advisor and former mayor only made his power grow more as he began operating and planning for national politics. He secured friendlier relations with the parties of the Union and eventually made his own, quickly joining the joint government coalition. With elections rolling forward, and a combination of his growing popularity, Bloomberg made his decision and threw his hat into the race. \n\nIn the end, Bloomberg won, and so he stood at the podium of the National Mall. Thousands of citizens were in the crowd in front of him, he couldn’t see their eyes very well from there he was, but he was sure each and every one of them was looking directly at him, waiting for him to begin. It was strange that now he would be president after all that had happened, but he couldn’t complain could he, this was what he had wanted after all. And so, he began his speech."

Yet; in the wake of many, the Union had managed to get back onto its feet in regards to a swift recovery; the election of the revered Kamala Harris. Harris; a fighting senator and former vice president, nearly instantly ascended the steps of Capitol Hill all the way to the White House in the aftermath of Biden's exodus. \n\nWhilst at hand, the idea of her as president was said to be a potentially controversial subject, noting it was a near unanimous decision within the convention, the Union is in a dire need of security. Thus, as the Betsy Ross flutters the inauguration ceremony, a jubilant Kamala, triumphant and determined, a fighter and a potential hero of America, and out of strength, simply raised her hand without the bible, and recited the oath."

Following the establishment of her presence, Ocasio-Cortez continued to pursue her political stance, garnering support among many progressives, the size of which rivaled the likes of Bernie Sanders. It was this support and a growing favor towards younger nominees that led her towards her nomination and election alike. While her campaign faced harsh resistance from the Conservatives and Liberal sides of the Union's population, she eventually was able to warm up those skeptical towards her, winning the election with a comfortable majority. \n\nIt is now that she stands on the podium of the National Mall, looking among the crowd and the various press that were spread out across the field in front of her, documenting the momentous occasion as the sun casted a warm glow over the sea of faces, reflecting the hope and anticipation of those who gathered to witness history.

He was one of the first to begin campaigning for the presidency, garnering a large supporter base of like-minded Conservatives and Liberals alike, while Progressives dismissed him. But his family ties, supporter base, and centrist policies had won him the election in a tight battle. He would become the second Kennedy to become president soon, and he couldn't be any happier. \n\nHe stood at the podium of the National Mall looking not at the crowd in front of him, but instead the clear blue sky that flew above. It was a way for him to get his nerves out before he would speak in front of a crowd, something he picked up only recently.

Yet, as crisis loomed both politically and militarily over his shoulders in the face of destruction, Biden still managed, even with a chip on his shoulder and furious attacks waged into him on a personal and political level; to continue forward with his administration and attempting to further safeguard the United States. Despite his multiple shortcomings in terms of being presentable to the American public, and the potential fallout that drained from it, the bipartisanship and maintenance of the coalition under his watch proceeded to strangle out most doubts of his capabilities as Commander in Chief. \n\nNow, for a second time ever since 2021; he now stood facing the National Mall site, with the Holy Bible at his side in preparation for a historical inauguration. A lot of emotion was built into his presidency, a sympathy with the American people as a whole, a feeling that stood with him ever since he entered the very steps of the US Senate in a world containing pain and misery. Yet, granted a second chance by the hand of god; there is still time to save America."

 usb.69.t: "The Inauguration Of Mitt Romney"
 usb.69.d: "Mitt Romney, former senator of Utah and 2012 electoral nominee, fled to the Union of America when his home state of Utah was engulfed in the nationwide civil war. Once he arrived, he quickly made moves to create a new Conservative movement within the Union, one that was against the Trumpists in Denver. In this he succeeded, gaining wide support over almost all Conservatives within the nation and even gaining support from some Liberals as well, while only facing the most staunch resistance from the Progressives. This support base, and his policies of 'common sense' propelled him towards his electoral victory. This victory, while only won by a tight margin, had more than enough of a good effect on Romney, giving him the much-needed energy and morale boost to continue his campaigning and rallies, even after his victory. \n\nHe stood at the podium of the National Mall with this newfound energy, looking upon the crowd in front of him, spotting the various press crews dotting the massive collection of people. It made him happy knowing that his dream of the presidency would finally come true. And no matter the situation he would be given once he obtained office, Romney mentally promised that he wouldn't back down, no matter the situation, no matter if the odds were stacked against him."

 usb.70.d: "Bloomberg was not a man built on hope. He had seen the worst of society, and society had seen the worst of him, but he was not one to back down or give up so easily. When the civil war broke out and Bloomberg took refuge in the Union, he immediately began offering his services to the government. Public deals, non-public deals, public negotiations, non-public negotiations, and more were all things that happened during this unnerving time, but slowly but surely, Bloomberg gained more and more power, and when the time was right, he formed his own party. It was rocky at first, but as time went on he drew more support. The establishment began to crumble, democracy was faltering, and with elections right around the corner, Bloomberg knew what he had to do. \n\nAnd so here he is, standing at the podium of the National Mall, looking upon the crowd of countless people, each one counting on him to save the Union. It would be tough, but he knew in his heart that what he was doing was right. That, even if some rules needed to be bent or broken, it would all be in the name of victory, of salvation, of the citizens who stood in front of him. And so he began to speak, for he had a job to do."
 usb.70.a: "The successor of democracy."
 usb.71.t: "Innovations Party is Founded"
 usb.71.d: "We recently received news of Michael Bloomburg's departure from the Democratic Party, and his subsequent forming of a new party, the Innovationist Party. \n\nEarlier today he announced his exit from the coalition during a session of Congress. He spoke passionately, criticizing our government, saying that we weren’t doing enough for the American people, how the Union was failing to unite America quickly enough, and more. He furthermore announced the creation of his new party, the Innovationists, soon after, he left the building, taking much of his entourage with him. \n\nHis creation of a new party has worried us the most seeing as how public support toward our current regime is trending downward, making maters worse for our nation. Only the future can tell if it will truly cause big problems, but we should keep watch on them in the meantime."

That's one of the pillars of our country! \n\nWhile we fight this brutal war, this awful conflict for the soul of our country, I can only think back to better times. For so many, stealing away in tents in refugee camps in once-prosperous cities those memories are all that they have. I remember when both parties believed in Democracy when the idea of one man turning one into an authoritarian cult around himself was unthinkable. I remember when we collaborated on important policy when both parties believed in the American idea of Democracy, Hope, and Freedom. I remember when both parties could denounce dictators like Saddam Hussein and Vladimir Putin, and not seek aid and comfort from them. We will bring that era back! We will have peace and cooperation in America! \n\nThis effort is not one made by one man. It is done by the whole country. Even my administration, I would say that it is a collective effort, I'm just the guy who keeps everything in check. I'm the one who makes sure the talented in our country get into the positions they need to be, in to do their work without fear of attacks by so-called Populists. I will make sure for the rest of my administration, that our Institutions go unchallenged, that our Democracy and those critical supports continue, for ourselves, and, and..."

 usb.76.t: "The Heir to America"
 usb.76.d: "In the wake of the death of our glorious and determined president, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr; the seeds of power have officially sprung up all across the nation. At least 3 successors have been noted as potentials in the wake of succeeding the American bloodline that is the presidency, by all means necessary. \n\nRobert Bruce Abrams is one of our greatest generalissimos and a flashy politician at the same time. He proceeded to act as one of the main bearers of the torch in Asia against the beasts of China and Russia, all among the Korean Peninsula and sending the opposition into an orbit towards American liberation. He can easily turn the tides on the Pacific theater, a sword engraved in the fires of war and hellbent on a hawkish foreign policy, a true heir to our heroes on all fronts. \n\nOn the second platform, we have the energetic, brash and powerfully nationalistic + charismatic, Richard Spencer. At first, he used to smear the true beacon of American identity and politics, until finally seeing the light 4 years ago and endorsing the former President, moving towards a path of staunchly defending the nation by all means necessary, an "Americanist" one puts it. His very upfront and straightforward attitude is great for the publicity and handling potential external affairs, but his past dangerously hangs on the balance. \n\nFinally, we have the president's son; Hunter Biden. Hunter was one of the main attack dogs of traitorous Republicans in a rallying cry against his father. Yet, Hunter stayed firm and continued on, proceeding to dismantle the opposition one by one, with his  demeanor and valor intimidating those around him, unpredictable just like his father. He would be quite the wild card of a pick, as he lacks the political merit and foreign policy intelligence of his peers, but can definitely be a chip on the shoulder against foreign opponents."

 POLITICS_JOE_BIDEN_DESC: "Joseph Robinette Biden has been a man often close to the greatest seat of power in America, but unable to take it. Born in Pennsylvania, Biden would spend much of his life and political career in the state of Delaware. He established himself firmly in the neoliberal Democratic camp in the Senate, where he supported foreign interventionism and \"tough on crime\" bills, and found allies in long-term Senate fixtures like Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd. He launched Presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008, but failed to pass the primaries both times.\n\nNormally, an aging twice-failed candidate who rubbed elbows with racists and warmongers would be a poor candidate for an increasingly youthful and progressive Democratic party. But Biden's eight years as Vice President for Barack Obama have done well to rehabilitate his legacy. And faced with the prospect of another four years of Donald Trump in the White House, the Democrats closed ranks and threw all their support behind him. At seventy-eight, Biden is now the oldest man to have been elected President. But where his supporters see a charismatic elder statesman capable of uniting left and right, his detractors see a half-senile windbag who let the Democrats prop him up so he could get his long-denied turn in the Oval Office. Whether he proves to be a venerable leader or a doddering old fool, one thing is clear: few envy his role as President during this difficult time."

Many millions of our fellow Americans have been corrupted, brought into the radical fold, and must be taught the error of their ways. \n\nThis great task has not been shouldered by any except my administration. In Congress, rival factions spent the Civil War arguing over taxation while our brave men and women in the armed forces fought for every right we hold dear. The Rule of Law hung in the balance as politicians bickered, and now they talk of pardons, of legislative agendas, of policies. Our country does not need more of that! It needs leadership. \n\nIt is with the powers invested in me as the Chief Executive of this land that I order Congress to take leave and end this session.

That man has ordered his soldiers to turn their guns on their fellow Americans, to meet any threats to his usurped power with wonton brutality and animalistic cruelty. He has gassed peaceful protestors and arrested political opponents. With a cavalier stroke, he has blotted out the Constitution and declared his word as the only law worth respecting. He has called his bloody handiwork an ''opportunity'' to reshape this country. \n\nArrayed against him are the remaining loyalists of the Army, Air Force, and Navy, community servants, elected officials, and our institutions.

Yet this great resource was once only available to the upper crust of society: The New England Boarding schools fed directly into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale: only the elites of the West sent their children to Berkely and Stanford. It was not until the end of World War Two with the G.I. Bill, that the average, everyday America entered the hallowed halls of Academia. \n\nYet, ever since, we have allowed academia to once again become an elite proving ground. Policies like Affirmative Action helped even the odds, but they were not enough. Our smartest working-class Americans were systematically frozen out of top universities, and others couldn't even afford state schools. Even if you could go, it almost felt like a scam; paying ridiculous sums just to have a chance at having a life like their parents.

For much of America, the old economic formulas don't work. The industry is revitalized, but some areas, reliant on coal or other outmoded industries, cannot be so simply rejuvenated. Minority areas have long struggled with poverty and racism, and no policy initiative has been strong enough to overcome that dark legacy. The tides of modernity, and the legacy of the past that hangs over our nation, prompted us to look for new measures. \n\nA solid system of economic aid for the unemployed, as well as a package to ease workers out of dying industries will finally be established by this Act. So many Americans have been caught in a tailspin of debt and poverty, with no help beyond paltry welfare which they often don't qualify for, due to their meager employment.

Black and brown Americans were once slaves, then second-class citizens, and even today still live under the onerous legacies of their past suffering. America has paid for its original sin in diverse ways, and repentance must come. What was originally conceived after our first Civil War, and formalized after the Civil Rights Act, must be strengthened. All citizens must have equal access to Our Democracy, and equal representation. \n\nWith this act, we can take yet another step in the long road to racial equity. No more shall discriminatory practices be implemented. All redistricting, all laws relating to the vote, must be cleared by the Federal Government. Gerrymandering shall no longer be permitted, and discrimination based on race, class, location, or political affiliation shall no longer hold any sway over redistricting.

 bdnspch.14.d: "''Many Conservatives have argued that unregulated, completely free markets are the best option. Looking at our history, I cannot take the same view. The callous abuses of the Gilded Age, and the countless corporate abuses that occurred since, prove that unregulated markets are just as destructive, if no more so in key areas, than Socialism would be. So many corporations have treated the well-being of their fellow citizens as a second concern, taking profit as the single goal of any enterprise. They say greed is good, and that some selfishness is healthy. This is a foolish idea that has caused so much pain. Trickle-down economics and offshoring have caused communities to collapse, while the ultra-wealthy have profited. \n\nNot every businessman is evil, not every investor has only his benefit in mind. However, the impulse and the incentive to engage in selfish behavior do not go away through good intentions; It must be fought with policy. Businesses must pay some of their profits into the public good, and they shouldn't be able to get away without paying through loopholes. We must also ensure that businessmen may never be able to dominate our politics, and self-fund their way to a dictatorship.''"

I hate to tell them, but the Founders have been dead for a long time. We have no idea what they would have wanted, and, frankly, they wouldn't even understand how different our world is. They didn't have the internet, or assault weapons, or any other modern innovation which fundamentally alters how we go about our lives. So why should we just settle with what they wrote? \n\nOur founders understood their limitations. They knew that the institutions needed to adapt and change, and thus promulgated a system to amend to the Constitution. On top of the Bill of Rights, we have added 15 Amendments since, defining our values and how Our Democracy functions. The rights of minorities, women, and all Americans have been solidified. So much has changed in America lately, that we need to revisit the Constitution. We must approach the whole thing like the Founders did; we must make something new, something that fits our country in all its diversity.''"

Ever since we've taken this office, the absolute integrity of this nation has only further increased throughout the survival of this tumultuous hour. Folks, I grew up in an America that was emboldened and true to itself, that sought for every person to gather the same opportunity necessary, no longer worried about adversity, not laying up at night wishing for a new dream, an American dream to come, when it's already there, in their grasp as they walk through a sea of glory. This deepening crisis only proves of our righteous might and resolve against tyranny, and that all Americans, will take the steps necessary to overcome urgency. We are a nation of action, not lying around in the face of a tinpot dictator, but moving with everything we got and having the tools to fix a dream, not throw it in the dust.

However, a great leap for these sectors is the basis of our markets, alongside getting away from the defeatist views of its operation, with our administration actively ensuring the country is safely afloat, allowing for consumers to frolic and achieve their goals without a fear to do so. American products to American jobs all float in that arena of market growth and economic innovation, which is the procurement for the support of our businesses and agencies for a safer and sustainable America. No more will special interests and loopholes attempt to remove prosperity within our nation, but a sea of prosperity shall be outlined and grow forward and allowing for a centralized, coordinated effort.''"

Folks, this has called for mandatory action among my administration, including looking towards our former landmark decisions in history. This includes for easier interagency cooperation with the American people, such as a necessary expansion of surveillance stretching every corner, to ensure this nation can no longer live in fear for themselves, but feel safe rather than facing the claws of horror being war each day. When I was younger, it was always a fear among our family about the toll of war, the worries of ourselves falling to tyrants everywhere to subversive elements in our society, feeding into those elements each day with zero remorse whatsoever. This is truly a precautionary measure to further derail any sense of internal destruction for stability in the wake of our fight for freedom.''"

Id like to reiterate: All of this is because of our forefathers, who wrote these sacred texts in the face of their own tyranny at home.

He talked about how some internet trolls aligned with the enemy almost re-routed a train carrying medical supplies by impersonating me! Can you believe how crazy that is! \n\nWell, Mr. Pichai and a few others ultimately concluded that access to their services was a privilege, not a right, and so most of the enemy now can't access Google, devices made by Apple, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and many more have been taken out of operation. Couple that with them being cut off from SWIFT and I think those traitors are going to get quite the headache! \nI just want to say, corporate America has been just phenomenal.

So while you can whine and raise some hell over overtime benefits, I think all of you will do your duty, you're Americans after all! \n\nThink of this as you polish off each bit of brass; so many Americans live under tyranny. Whether it be radicals, or the tyrant in Denver. Our country's system of laws, its institutions, are under threat.

While it may seem a little, uh, uncanny now, I have been told it will improve exponentially in the coming years and even months. \n\nIn this domain, we have a total advantage over the Denver tyrant. This tech will enable us to rededicate valuable resources from various basic clerical functions, and more can be put into managing the war effort.

In times like these, when the situation may seem overwhelmingly dire and hope can appear elusive, it is crucial to remember why we are engaged in this struggle. We are not just fighting to defend ourselves; we are fighting for something far more profound. We are fighting for freedom, for the preservation of democracy, and for the fundamental right of every individual to live in peace and harmony. \n\nOur ground troops are on the front lines, engaged in fierce battles and enduring great sacrifices. They are the ones who face the brunt of the conflict, paving the way toward the greater cause we all hold dear. Their bravery and tenacity set the foundation for the future victories we strive for. In this pivotal moment, I urge you to extend your unwavering support to these brave men and women. Your role, though it may come with its own set of challenges and stress, is of immense significance. The aerial efforts you contribute are not merely tactical maneuvers but vital components of our overarching strategy. Your work will have a monumental impact on the future battles we face, and every mission you undertake is crucial in shaping the course of this war. Remember that your dedication and hard work are integral to our collective success.

You have faced numerous challenges, and today, you stand as a testament to your own grit and determination. I am truly proud of each and every one of you. Now, with that commendation aside, let me speak to you candidly. The path that lies ahead of you will not be easy. Your future jobs, your upcoming missions, your assignments–everything you are about to undertake–will test you in ways you can scarcely imagine. They will be fraught with stress, danger, and the potential for grave consequences. The stakes are high, and you will encounter situations that push the boundaries of your endurance and bravery. I have no doubt that many of you are feeling a sense of nervous anticipation. Believe me, if I were in your position, I would share those feelings. Your limits will be stretched to their very edge and beyond. And yet, here you are, standing ready to embrace the challenges that lie ahead. \n\nThis is what I call true bravery–courage that manifests in the face of fear and adversity. It is this very courage that I urge each of you to embody as you move forward. You must confront every challenge head-on, no matter how daunting it may seem. Each day will present new obstacles and difficulties, but it is through overcoming these that you will achieve greatness. What you do will be remarkable and will shape the future of our Air Force and our Union. Remember, the importance of pushing beyond your limits cannot be overstated. Failure to do so may lead to dire circumstances, ones from which there may be no easy escape. Your actions will not be forgotten; they will be remembered as a reflection of your commitment and your courage. In closing, I leave you with your motto–a phrase that encapsulates the essence of your journey and the spirit with which you should approach every challenge.

Your work here is not just a job; it is a critical contribution to a cause greater than ourselves–the cause of Democracy. The nature of the task before us requires more than just diligence; it demands an extraordinary level of commitment and sacrifice. The planes you meticulously assemble, the missiles you engineer, the ammunition you stockpile–each of these elements plays a crucial role in our ongoing struggle. I recognize that you have been laboring tirelessly, pouring your effort into every component, and for that, I am deeply grateful. However, the gravity of our situation calls for even greater exertion. The Union demands it, and our very future depends on it. \n\nThe battle in the skies is relentless and unforgiving. Despite our current advantage, our enemies have the resources to challenge our numerical superiority. They can also advance their tactics often leaving our pilots outmatched. An additional jet in the midst of combat can drastically alter the outcome of any mission, tipping the scales in our favor. This is why we need to push beyond our current limits. I understand that this request is not small. It means asking you to dig deeper, to extend your workday, to give more of yourselves–your sweat, your blood, and your tears. The sacrifices you make here are not in vain; they are a direct investment in the future of our nation, in the safety and prosperity of your families, and the promise of a better tomorrow for each and every one of you. This is a pivotal moment in our history, and your contribution is indispensable. The strength of our resolve and the quality of our output will determine not only the success of our missions but the very essence of our democratic ideals.

There are those who work tirelessly, day and night, seeking to undermine everything we hold dear. These enemies are not distant; they are among us.

Their goal is clear: to destabilize the foundation upon which America and this government stands. And it is your responsibility, as citizens, to remain vigilant. \n\n''The moment you sense something is amiss, the second you feel suspicious, do not hesitate. Report it. Too much is at stake for caution. Too much could be lost if you second-guess your instincts. America itself is on the line. You are the first line of defense in a chain of protection that shields our nation from those who wish to do it harm. Your actions today could prevent a greater disaster tomorrow.'' \n\n''And remember, loyalty can be a fleeting thing. Even those closest to you, those you once believed to be dedicated to the cause of this nation, may falter. Temptation, fear, or manipulation can turn a once-loyal heart toward evil. It will not be easy to raise suspicions about someone you once trusted, but the stakes are far too high to ignore any warning signs. Know that when you take the difficult step of reporting suspicious activity, you are not acting in vain. You are playing a crucial role in the defense of our country. Your courage is the first step toward our ultimate goal: a safer, stronger, and more resilient America.''"

Only a while ago had Joesph Biden died, but many were not told of his death.\nIt was up to him to inform the loyal masses and take the reins of government.\n\n''Hello, all gathered here tonight. Many of you were invited here with little knowledge of the cause of this meeting, I am here to inform you of such. Our dear leader, Joeseph R. Biden, has passed away. It was a peaceful passing, little pain was experienced on his end, however, it was more than gut-wrenching for us. It is with his death that the leader of this nation is now vacant. So I, Robert Bruce Abrams, declare, with the support of our former leader, that I will take the position of president and lead our nation onward.''\n\n''My first decision as the leader of our proud nation is to hold a week of mourning for our deceased leader and celebrate all his efforts that have put us in the position we are now.'' \nAbrams looked onward to the crowd, scanning the faces of those who were in front of him. The reactions varied, but Abrams could confidently say that overall, nobody seemed angry or bitter about his new power. Soon, the transfer of power would go over on a much wider scale, and Abrams would be free to continue in the footsteps of the former president.\n\nSomething he would truly enjoy."

Biden, or the husk of what remained, would be watching this, it would be crucial that this speech was perfect, his life and his family depended on it. If he didn't deliver the finale of his speech perfectly... he didn't want to think about it. \n\nObama began to speak once again, the cameras of photographers continuously flashed the room, the crowd looked unto him. Unto the puppet that he was. The spotlights almost seemed to get brighter, while everything else became darkened out. \nUntil a man in the crowd stood up.\n''Death to the tyrant!''\n\nScreaming. Chaos. Terror. The darkness receded and the lights dimmed down, Obama almost calmed down for a moment, before the pain began to set in. A bullet had hit him straight in the neck. He grasped at it, trying to cover the wound and stop the blood from pouring out, falling upon the floor while doing so. As bodyguards surrounded him, and paramedics attempted to save him, Obama suddenly gave up on saving himself. Oddly, he felt a sense of relief, no longer would he have to put up an act.

Shockingly, one of our own, and several co-conspirators has been discovered to be involved in this heinous act. Those being traitor Angus King and numerous government and civilian sympathizers. Even more alarming, they appear to have been in talks with none other than the exiled Bernie Sanders, who has been at the center of a covert plot to overthrow our rightful government. The assassination of Obama, a respected symbol of progress, marks their most recent and egregious step toward their ultimate goal: a full-blown coup against our nation's institutions. \n\nWe have labored ceaselessly, day and night, as a united force of lawmakers and public servants, working to heal and rebuild the fabric of this great nation. Through countless sacrifices and tireless efforts, we've made significant strides in repairing the damage, lifting up our country from its darkest moments, and striving to reunify its people. Countless lives have been lost in the name of this noble cause - patriots who gave everything to ensure a brighter future for generations to come. And yet, in the face of such dedication, how are we repaid? With betrayal. With cowardly assassinations, malicious deceit, and treachery from those who were supposed to stand beside us. \n\nWe should not be surprised by the actions of these traitors. The very individuals who conspire against our government, who use underhanded tactics to undermine the progress we've made, are no better than the enemies we confront on the battlefield. They are cut from the same cloth - devoid of honor, driven by selfish ambition, and prepared to destroy the very nation they pretend to care for. \n\nAction must be swift and decisive. There can be no hesitation in the face of such treachery. Our enemies, whether on the frontlines or hidden within the walls of power, must be rooted out and brought to justice. The future of our nation depends on it."

No longer will we tolerate those who seek to undermine the stability and security of our country. \nThe supporters of Angus King and Bernie Sanders, those who have conspired against us have been located and identified. Alarmingly, many of these traitors are entrenched within our political system, wielding significant power and influence over our nation's laws and policies. It is a sobering reality that among the ranks of these conspirators are not only corrupt politicians but also civilians who have been swept up in their deceit. Though we are stretched thin, and our resources are limited, we must act decisively on these individuals as well. Only those who pose the most immediate and serious threat to our nation will face the swift justice they deserve. \n\nOnce the great purge is complete, and our government has been cleansed of these malign forces, we will enter a new era of governance. The seats of power that were once occupied by those who betrayed their country will be refilled, but not as they once were. Some offices will be dissolved and absorbed entirely, while others will be replaced by more loyal individuals. In certain cases, some will be replaced by advanced artificial intelligence, ensuring that the mundane but critical tasks of bureaucracy are handled with precision, speed, and unwavering commitment to the nation's well-being. \nThese are undoubtedly difficult times, but this necessary purge will pave the way for a brighter, stronger, and more unified future. It will ensure that the foundation of our government is built on loyalty, efficiency, and unwavering dedication to the survival and prosperity of our people. And perhaps, once this purge has demonstrated its success, it will be expanded to ensure that every facet of our society is purified, every last corner of treachery expunged. Our civilization will emerge stronger, more unified, and more capable than ever before, a model for the world to admire.\n\nWe will build a future that is not only secure but worthy of awe - a nation reborn through the fire of justice and the cleansing of treason."

Found within Sanders' home were an array of documents and paperwork, the most notable of which were within a folder next to Sanders' bed. Inside detailed his method of escape. He had apparently left earlier that morning, taking with him his family and some close relatives as he took a ride on a helicopter to god knows where. \n\nSome of Sanders' staff and similar figureheads, like him, escaped, but most were captured. A portion of those who were captured put up quite a fight, resulting in several casualties. Despite these incidents, our other operations have largely proceeded without a hitch, and compliance has been successfully secured in most areas across the nation. With Sanders' supporters subdued, the public atmosphere has become more manageable, and our influence is being solidified. \n\nHowever, it is still Sanders who poses a big problem. With his escape, he remains free to plan and organize any resistance against us. Given his influence and popularity, he could quickly rally discontented factions and disrupt our government. Intelligence suggests he still has numerous allies who are willing to support him, and as long as he remains at large, the threat of whatever he can do will loom over our heads."

The decision to initiate such a purge came after the assassination of Obama, and the subsequent investigation which showed that many in our government had ties to Bernie Sanders, who has been trying to overthrow our government as of late. \n\nThe purge itself went relatively well. Some figures escaped, but many were captured and tried for their crimes against this glorious nation. The only reasonable sentence that they deserved was death. But while their deaths are a triumph for the future of this nation, it is what we have been doing, and will continue to do after this purge that is more important. \n\nRecently we have been refilling and or reforming the positions that were previously held by those traitors, many of these seats have been absorbed and some have been refilled with more loyal and trustworthy individuals. However, some have instead been replaced with AI. This is one of the more important steps in our goal to get our government up to speed and become more efficient. This test trial, as you will, has gone over smoothly, with the boring and more mundane tasks of bureaucracy becoming quicker, more efficient, and more. Truly it is one of the first stepping stones in this long process, but the future holds the keys to utopia, and we will be the first to achieve it."

This internal reckoning, while necessary, ignited a spark—a vision of something greater, something more transformative. It became clear that this initial purge was but a precursor, the first step toward a larger movement that would redefine our nation’s future. \n\nMany meetings have since taken place, with hours of careful deliberation and intense debate about the path forward. Today, we stand at the threshold of a monumental decision: the need for a more expansive and public purge, one that will reach every corner of the nation. This decisive action, driven by the will of our leadership, is no longer a mere possibility; it is a certainty. The ‘Great Release,’ as it has come to be known among our cabinet members, will soon become a day of liberation for all citizens. On this day, they will be free—free from the restraints of law, from the burdens of control, free to express their deepest emotions, their anger, their hatred, without fear of consequence. For one day each year, the chains of order will be loosened, granting them the catharsis they have long been denied.\nSome voices, quieter but persistent, have expressed concerns and dissatisfaction with this plan. Yet we have assured them—and continue to do so—that this release is essential for the long-term stability and prosperity of the nation. \n\nThe Great Release is not just a day of freedom; it is a necessary release valve, a way to prevent the greater, more destructive violence that would otherwise build beneath the surface. By allowing this controlled chaos, we provide a safe outlet, a day where people can purge their darkest thoughts and return to normalcy, unburdened by their pent-up fury.\n\nAs we embark on this new phase of our glorious nation’s evolution, we remain steadfast in our belief that this is the right course of action. We are confident that the Great Release will lead to a stronger, more united country, one where the balance between order and chaos is finally struck, ensuring the longevity and stability of our society."

 bdnspch.111.t: "The Release Upon Us"
 bdnspch.111.d: "It was a chilly morning when President Biden appeared across every screen in the nation. The image of him seated in the Oval Office, his face solemn, hands clasped together on the desk, flickered on TVs, phones, and tablets in homes, offices, and public spaces alike. His gaze was steady as he stared deep into the camera, as though he could see the millions of anxious eyes staring back at him, waiting for what would come next. The air seemed to hang heavy with anticipation, an unsettling calm before the storm. \n\nThe time was exactly 7:26 AM when he began to speak. \n\n''Dear loyal compatriots of America,'' he started, his voice steady but carrying the weight of what was to follow. ''I am here as your president, to address you about what will transpire later today. After careful consideration, and in agreement with others in positions of authority, I have come to a decision that I believe is necessary for the good of this nation. At 9:00 PM tonight, all violent crime will be made legal for 24 hours.'' \n\nSome were in disbelief, others in fear, and a few—perhaps—nodded along. But that fact remained in all their minds, and there was no turning back now. The president continued, his tone unwavering, explaining the reasoning behind this shocking decision. He spoke of societal decay, of humanity, of the need for a radical shift in the nation’s approach to violence. It was, in his eyes, the ultimate decision-a means to purge the darkness within and reset the course of the country’s future. He referred to the idea as a release valve, a necessity for preserving the greater good. \n\n''Today is a National Day of Release, those of you who understand will make use of this time, those of you who don’t will most likely cower in fear, but for those who have betrayed this nation. Your time is nigh.'' \n\nThe broadcast ended, the picture of Biden disappearing at exactly 7:30 AM. The broadcast was only 4 minutes long and yet it had left an impact that would ripple across years, only leaving a black screen with a timer of 13 hours and 30 minutes on it, and a few words."

From the bustling cities to the quietest corners of the countryside, citizens poured into the streets, fueled by years of pent-up anger, frustration, and the all-consuming need for release. The air was thick with chaos, the cries of vengeance mingling with the sound of breaking glass and shattering lives. \n\nYes, some are horrified. Some cling to the old ways of thinking, decrying the violence as barbaric and immoral. They say it is wrong to glorify murder, to celebrate the breakdown of social norms. But these voices are fading. For the rest of us, the majority, we see the truth clearly now. This day-the carnage, the fury-was not a breakdown of society. It was its preservation. Through blood and fire, we have cleansed ourselves. By allowing the darkness to surface once a year, we maintain the fragile peace for the other 364 days. It is in this purging of our collective rage that our nation remains stable, unshaken by the petty grievances and the weight of suppressed desires that have brought other civilizations to ruin. \n\nThis is the truth, The Day of Release, as horrific as it may seem to many, is the ultimate act of preservation. In letting our people indulge their basest instincts for a short time, we protect them from the need to act on those impulses year-round. It is an agreement, a pact between the governed and the government, one that ensures our survival as a nation. \nAnd for that, we are stronger than ever."

The quiet rage simmering beneath the surface of society is given full reign, and those once shackled by the morals of a bygone era finally taste true freedom. This day, once met with fear and doubt, has evolved into the cornerstone of our nation’s stability. It is a day where order is not only upheld by the government but reinforced by the very citizens we govern. \n\nWhat began as a bold experiment has since revolutionized our society. The National Day of Release serves as a stark reminder of how far we’ve come, proof that our sacrifices and our visions were not in vain. We have birthed a new America, one that has cast aside outdated ideologies and morals in order to forge a future where peace and stability are sustained through the precise management of chaos. We have birthed an America where each year brings us closer to a utopia that was once thought unattainable, now nearly within our grasp. \n\nThis is the new world we’ve built, one forged in fire and violence, but maintained through careful balance. Each Day of Release marks a step forward in perfecting a society where freedom and control coexist in harmony. Our future has never been brighter, nor is our path more certain."

Why was he reading this paper? Was there ever even a crowd here? \n''Hello? Are you listening to me? Where is everyone?'' \nHe returned to the letter, finding a compelling force for him to read it, but the letter he had read from mere moments before was gone, but a napkin with his name scribble across it was in its place."
