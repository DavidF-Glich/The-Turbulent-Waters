 MAC_fading_antiquisation: "Policy of Pragmatism"
 MAC_fading_antiquisation_desc: "The Macedonia name dispute has flared up nationalism in our population, as the vile Greeks interpreted the name of our country that was literally the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an excuse for irredentism amongst our populace to claim the Greek region of Macedonia. Now that the hatchet has been buried, and we voted to amend the name of our nation to North Macedonia - Greece has finally stopped vetoing our attempts to ascend into the EU. Despite the dispute being largely resolved, many of our politicians are still grumbling about being pressured by another state to change our name - as a result swaying some of our voter base to join populist parties who aim to reverse the change."

 MAC_lukewarm_ethnic_tensions: "Lukewarm Ethnic Tensions"
 MAC_lukewarm_ethnic_tensions_desc: "The Macedonia naming dispute may have been buried, but that does not mean that other Balkan grudges had vanished. In particular, we have a massive minority of Albanians on the western reaches of our country, with a smaller minority of Bulgarians to the east. Despite the Ohrid Agreement and the liberalization of our nation's personal freedoms, many Albanians are still fiercely nationalistic to their own people and not to our flag, and the Bulgarians minority are more loyal to Sofia than us due to us not ratifying the 2017 Friendship treaty with Bulgaria. The biggest incident since the new millennium was the flare up of ethnic violence in 2012 when our Macedonians and Albanian populations clashed over cases of police brutality and several arrests. One of the clauses for us to join the EU was to resolve any standing disputes within our nation, and so far our lack of unity has been one of our roadblocks to ascension. Until our people learn to shake hands and to not fight between each other like our neighbours, our dream of joining the EU will remain a mere fantasy."
 MAC_ineffective_legal_system: "Ineffective Legal System"
 MAC_ineffective_legal_system_desc: "A trademark of the dissolution of Yugoslavia was the skyrocketing of corruption as the people of the Balkans, which had largely lived under planned economies and socialism, were suddenly met with a market capitalist economy with zero experience towards approaching it. While we managed to avoid most of the disaster that ensued with the collapse, our republic had unfortunately inherited the ineffective legal system of Yugoslavia, and it had begun to rear its ugly head with the past decade. With a lack of proper enforcement, a weak bureaucracy and judiciary, not to mention critical underfunding, it had inadvertently lead to continued rise of corruption and stagnant efforts on combating crime, with it going as far to allow 20% of our GDP to be made up of blackmarket goods caused by our huge grey market."
