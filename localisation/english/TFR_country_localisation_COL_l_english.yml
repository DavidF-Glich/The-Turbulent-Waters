 COL.4.t: "Colombia in Chaos"
 COL.4.d: "Colombia has plunged into civil war following a military coup d'etat shortly after the recent election that saw Gustavo Petro assume the presidency. The nation now finds itself embroiled in a violent free-for-all, with various factions, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National Liberation Army (ELN), and Clan del Golfo, vying for control of the country.\n\nThe coup has exacerbated pre-existing tensions and fueled rivalries among these armed groups, leading to a dramatic escalation of violence across Colombia. The situation has been further complicated by the ongoing Second American Civil War and the Central American conflict, which have left a power vacuum in the region and limited the capacity for international intervention. As the country spirals into chaos, the Colombian government has struggled to maintain control, with the military divided and regional governments facing mounting pressure from the warring factions. Civilians caught in the crossfire have been forced to flee their homes, exacerbating the already dire humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nInternational response to the Colombian civil war has been hampered by the ongoing crises in the United States and Central America. The United Nations has called for an urgent meeting to address the rapidly deteriorating situation and explore potential avenues for conflict resolution. With no end in sight to the violence, the future of Colombia and the broader region hangs in the balance."
