 USA_political_establishment: "Political Establishment"
 USA_political_establishment_desc: "The American political system has always been designed to support 2 parties, and 2 parties only. It's first past the post voting system has ensured that no third party could legitimately challenge the 2 incumbent parties reigning in the halls of Washington. While many criticize this system as anti-democratic for suppressing minority voices, some even going as far to call it a duopoly, its supporters have praised it for its stability, ensuring that the American system does not allow extremism within its system. this, more and more Americans seem to be growing tired of the old politicians in Washington, and have been drifting toward populist third parties."
 USA_political_establishment_challenged: "Political Establishment Challenged"
 USA_political_establishment_challenged_desc: "The political system in the United States has always served only the two major parties. The two-party system inherently excludes the possibility of any third-party challenging the ruling party that comfortably sits at the top of the Washington Hall. Despite many criticisms of this anti-democratic system, opposition to the suppression of minority voices, and even calling it a \"duopoly,\" supporters praise this political system that can prevent extremism from infiltrating the system. Now, various forms of legal corruption and political donations are rampant among the two parties, leading to an increasing number of American citizens becoming tired of the traditional politicians in Washington and turning to support populist third parties, which is also a key reason why Trump could defy the polls and enter the political arena. §3However, there are players outside the system besides Trump.§!"
 USA_second_amendment_idea: "Second Amendment"
 USA_second_amendment_idea_desc: "The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" Such language has created considerable debate regarding the Amendment's intended scope. On the one hand, some believe that the Amendment's phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\" creates an individual constitutional right for citizens of the United States. Under this \"individual right theory,\" the United States Constitution restricts legislative bodies from prohibiting firearm possession, or at the very least, the Amendment renders prohibitory and restrictive regulation presumptively unconstitutional. On the other hand, some scholars point to the prefatory language \"a well regulated Militia\" to argue that the Framers intended only to restrict Congress from legislating away a state's right to self-defense. In recent years this issue has gotten more to the fore front of the political landscape then ever before."

 USA_political_division: "Political Division"  
 USA_political_division_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Political_Division\n\n\n\n\n\nA House Divided Cannot Stand, said Abraham Lincoln in 1858, the election before the first American Civil War. Those fateful words have echoed through the halls of the DNC during the primary in 2019, an ominous sign for the upcoming election. Electoral gridlock has gripped Congress, as bickering between the politicians has stopped any meaningful legislation from passing. Out on the streets of Portland to the dinner table in Florida, political tensions about all subjects, ranging from culture to economics, threatens to tear this country apart."
 USA_political_division1: "Political Division"
 USA_political_division1_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_Political_Division\n\n\n\n\n\nAt present, the United States has become the most polarized country in the world. In the context of high polarization, the centrists of the two parties have disappeared, the Democratic Party has become more and more left, and the Republican Party has become more and more right. The issues involved in the polarization of American politics mainly include domestic issues such as immigration, gun control, same-sex marriage, and police policy. On the above issues, there is basically no consensus between the two parties in the United States. In the legislative process involving the above issues, in addition to endless arguments between the two parties, the voting pattern presents the characteristics of \"veto politics\" of opposing for the sake of opposing. The direct result of the high polarization of American politics is a serious decline in legislative efficiency. The legislative process is often paralyzed, which has become the norm in American politics. Against this background, the operation of American politics has been seriously affected, so much so that American scholar Francis Fukuyama believes that political polarization has led to the decline of American democracy."

While many Americans have reaped the rewards of the thriving market, others have criticized it for being unfair, citing the difference between the millions of Americans who can barely afford healthcare while the ultra-rich relax on their private yachts.

 USA_medium_immigration_idea_desc: "Illegal Immigration remains one of the most controversial socioeconomic issues of Modern America. Although much lower now than it was during the early 2000s-2010s, tens of thousands of illegal immigrants still cross the border every year. Such flow of illegal immigrants coming from the south have angered many elements of the culturally conservative, wondering why their taxpayer dollars are going to people who don't even pay taxes. On the further right, white supremacist ideals such as 'great replacement theory' have started to gain traction."

 USA_world_police_idea: "World Police"
 USA_world_police_idea_desc: "If you ask a number of different people for their view on American military involvement in the Middle East, you're likely to get a number of different, strong opinions. Many Americans believe that the U.S. government should focus on domestic affairs, and that what happens in the Middle East is ''none of our business.'' Others believe that in this modern era, America must have a global presence in order to protect its interests. Differences of opinion over American interventionism in foreign affairs are nothing new; they have been present since almost the founding of the United States itself."
 USA_oil_crisis_idea: "Oil Crisis"
 USA_oil_crisis_idea_desc: "Oil. It is what everything was run on for decades. The containers the world produced, the fuel for vehicles, the tarmac on the roads, everything leads back to crude oil. A single sign of a shortage was enough to send many economies spiralling out of control - but, at least until 2020, major catastrophes had been avoided. Now, however, in the face of the breakdown of the global system, the Saudi collapse and the domestic situation, oil has been much harder to get a hold of. The global market has been deprived of its black oxygen, and now, as a major utiliser of the fossil fuel, we feel the effect of this crisis most deeply. Until it is over, our economic capacity is locked away - and our people suffer for it."

In economics, it means that a country has no economic ties with foreign countries in its economic activities, such as no international trade or international financial or labor exchanges. There are only domestic economic activities, and there is no close contact between the domestic economy and foreign economies. This is called a closed economy."

 POLITICS_DONALD_TRUMP_DESC: "Donald John Trump is the most divisive American politician in living memory. Son of New York real estate mogul Fred Trump, Donald transformed his father's company from a chain of hotels and casinos into an international brand devoted to his personal image more than anything else. He dipped his toes in the political waters in 2000 and 2012, but finally dove in during the 2016 Presidential elections. In upset after upset, he eventually secured the Republican nomination and defeated former Senator and First Lady Hillary Clinton in the general election. The man many wrote off as doing a short-lived vanity campaign was now President of the United States.\n\nNearly everything about Trump, from his policies to his personality, defies conventional wisdom in Washington. He's carried over several of his trademark business philosophies: never make a deal without an immediate tangible benefit for yourself, there's no such thing as bad press, and when something goes badly, never, EVER admit you lost. His supporters praise him as refreshingly candid, giving a voice to the disaffected in middle America, and willing to stand up to an ossified and corrupt federal system. His many critics, meanwhile, condemn him as a thin-skinned narcissist who panders to the far-right fringe and will gladly destroy democratic traditions for the sake of his ego. But few on either side of the aisle deny his skill at getting people angry and mobilized, whether for or against him."
 POLITICS_JOE_BIDEN_DESC: "Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. has been a man often closest to the greatest seat of power but has been unable to take it. Born in Pennsylvania, Biden would define most of his personal and political life in Delaware, serving as Senator for over 30 years, establishing himself firmly as part of the Democratic Party leadership. Now, as the country faces it's worst crisis yet, Biden has answered the call of the Democrats, grasping the seat of power at long last. Treading carefully between the left, center and right wings of the party, Biden must steady the ship of Federal Government against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n\nBiden has oft been a controversial politician even within the party, with his past associations with Storm Thurmond and \"tough on crime\" bills drawing opponents on the left, while his his opponents on the right fear that his authoritative approach on putting down the raging revolutions and vast government stimulus plans bring America closer to tyranny. At 78, Biden is the oldest man to have been elected president. Where his detractors see an ailing figurehead grasping for his last shot at power and legacy, his supporters see an experienced statesman facing down all enemies to emerge victorious.\n\nWith the threat of the extinction of American democracy staring him down, Biden has gambled it all - he will be remembered as the man who saved democracy, or the one who nailed the coffin shut. One thing is certain; few envy his role in history."

 usa.1.t: "The American Century"
 usa.1.d: "America through the past 100 years has been considered the world's premier power, with the best economy the world has ever seen, a huge diverse landmass with a multitude of resources and people, and has become world's premier democratic nation. The last hundred years have provided the United States free range to spread it's ideas, with her enemies collapsing at her might. However, the demons of America's past have come to haunt her, ringing through her head ever louder as the days drawl on. The many voices cry for reparations for Black Americans who were once in chains throughout the Deep South, with liberation coming to them through the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 during the American Civil War, and later in 1865 the 13th Amendment was ratified abolishing slavery. However, not all was right, for they were theoretically free, but the Southerners kept them as slaves in all but name. This was finally ended with the Civil Rights Act in 1964. However, the effects of slavery are still felt and racial relations have declined dramatically over the past few decades, leading to constant bouts over whether or not America is founding on the suffering of others or the liberty of the individual."

 usa.2.t: "The Current Situation"
 usa.2.d: "Across the world, across Earth, across the cradle of humanity, a new decade has arisen. New Year's fireworks are still going off across the globe, and many are still creating their New Year's resolutions. In fact, the United States of America is not doing anything much different. With every decade it is tradition for our nation to overview the situations we face, whether it be economically, globally, or politically.\n\nEconomically, the nation has enjoyed relative stability over the past few years. Inflation and prices have been kept at a manageable level, and development has continued as expected across the country, however, much of this economic stability hinges on one crucial factor: oil. The growing dependence on what has become the 'new gold' of the world is vital to maintaining our nation's balance. Should our primary supplier cut off its supply, the United States could quickly find itself in a severe crisis. On the international front, the U.S. has faced a similar climate of tension in recent years. Disputes and incidents do arise, but they are generally handled through diplomatic channels or strategic interventions, ensuring that these issues remain contained and do not spiral out of control. Despite these challenges, the United States' sphere of influence remains largely stable, however, constant overwatch is needed in order to maintain our reach.\n\nOf the three main sets of problems the USA faces every decade, it is now the political system of grandeur that inhabits the machinations of our nation, that is our biggest issue. With the presidential race in full swing and election night rapidly approaching, political tension across the country has reached an unnerving level. Political anger is on the rise, and the polarization among citizens has become increasingly alarming. What were once simple differences in opinion have now led some individuals to adopt extreme stances, with many even arming themselves over political disagreements.\n\nWhile the challenges the United States faces in this new decade may appear straightforward at first glance, it is ultimately the outcome of the upcoming election that will decide the course of the nation. The stakes have never been higher, and the decisions made on election night will shape the future of the Land of the Free for years to come."

Despite the Michigan incident and other so-called \"out of thin air\" votes being counted as Democratic votes, when the dust settled, Joe Biden was certified as the winner by the Electoral College and elected President of the United States.\n\nThe euphoria of the celebrations was short-lived, and the country was still shaken by the chaos caused by the election. When Biden becomes president as usual, he will govern a country that supports all the radical policies he opposes and sings against him, while his supporters The only reason they rally around him is simply because he is not Trump. If he does not implement radical policies that unite the participants of the \"movement\", support for him may dissipate immediately. \n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump, who still has presidential power for the next two weeks, claims that the election results are a fraud and says he intends to sue the Democratic Party for election fraud in the Supreme Court given that the Democratic Party's narrow wins in several states are questionable. \n\nMichael Flynn and others associated with Anonymous Q have reportedly been asked to hold a meeting in the White House as soon as possible. Some people worry that if the election is not rerun, the current president may take more drastic measures. "
 usa.27.a: "Pence, you traitor!"
 usa.27.b: "We did it!"
 usa.15.t: "Pelosi's visit to Taiwan was called off"
 usa.15.d: "Out of fear of a direct war between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait and the anger of the Chinese Communist Party, the Taiwanese government sent a notice to Pelosi and us, hoping to stop Pelosi's visit to Taiwan."
 usa.15.a: "We just had to give up."
 usa.16.t: "The bomb arrived with Pelosi"
 usa.16.d: "The Chinese fighter jets did not attack Pelosi's plane. However, when Pelosi got off the plane, an accident still happened: dozens of rockets suspected to be from mainland China roared in and launched a wave of attacks on Taipei Airport. Perhaps it was intentional by the Chinese Communist Party or due to technological limitations, the explosion site of the missiles was still far away from Tsai Ing-wen and her entourage, so the attack did not cause casualties.\nPelosi muttered about China's attack in the message she sent to us, hysterically condemning the Chinese Communist Party's surprise attack. But since Xi Jinping still hasn't killed us, we'd better get out of it."
 usa.16.a: "The unlucky ones go back to Taiwan!"
 usa.16.b: "Fuck you, I'm going to make the fire rise anyway!"
 usa.17.t: "Coronavirus cases increase"
 usa.17.d: "As the number of COVID-19 cases across the country has increased dramatically, the number of people who are quarantined and unable to study and work normally has skyrocketed, and our economy has been hit hard."
 usa.17.a: "Uh... this isn't good"
 usa.17.b: "The 'Trump virus' strikes again!"
 usa.19.t: "The election is coming"
 usa.19.d: "This year has been a test for President Trump. The outcome of this election will determine the future of the country and serve as a referendum on the president's populist platform."
 usa.19.a: "Come on, work for another four years!"
 usa.19.b: "Come on, follow Joe!"
 usa.20.t: "2020 Election - Results Delayed"
 usa.20.d: "Like the last presidential election, it has taken quite some time to count the results of the election. But unlike last time, this time the counting took so long that it was not completed even after most of the polling counters had gone to bed. So far, Joe Biden and Donald Trump seem to be evenly matched, and most media outlets predict that Biden will win the election."
 usa.20.a: "Come on people, say no to Sleepy Joe!"
 usa.20.b: "Please spare me, the delay is normal!"
 usa.21.t: "2020 Election - Ballot Interference"
 usa.21.d: "Video provided by an anonymous source shows a truck unloading bags of ballots outside a Georgia polling station and pushing them into the polling station building after the polls closed at 4 a.m. to count votes. Others on social media claim they have seen similar trucks and people unloading ballots into polling stations across the country hours after they closed, while the media and Democrats vigorously deny any allegations and Joe Biden appears to be leading in the election. Whatever the truth, the public is beginning to lose confidence in the electoral system..."
 usa.21.a: "There's something fishy going on here..."
 usa.21.b: "It's just a concentration of votes..."
 usa.22.t: "2020 Election - Media Stands for Joe"
 usa.22.d: "Several major state media outlets declared Biden the winner. In some states, Biden managed to reverse his disadvantage and won narrowly in many swing states. As election interference became more and more of a public focus in this election, many people began to abandon the media, even some media that supported Trump in the past. Trump's campaign team, the Republican Party and independents have initiated legal proceedings in several states to question the results announced by the states."
 usa.22.a: "They are playing with fire!"
 usa.22.b: "Great job!"
 usa.23.t: "2020 Election- Trump holds rally"
 usa.23.d: "Despite warnings against large social gatherings and the so-called \"resistance\" movement, President Trump held a rally to ensure his base and fellow Republicans know he will continue to fight to win a second term while exposing the Never Trump faction that is exploiting Trump for their own political gain."
 usa.23.a: "This is the hypocritical media!"
 usa.23.b: "Losers eat dust!"
 usa.24.t: "2020 Election - Texas lawsuit dismissed"
 usa.24.d: "As legal developments regarding the Trump campaign moved swiftly and the deadline for filing challenges approached, it became increasingly clear that the issue would eventually make its way to the Supreme Court. Texas filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court against four swing states that appeared to support Biden, alleging that the states had unconstitutionally changed their election laws before the election and that their votes should not be counted. Texas claimed that it had standing to sue on the grounds that the election results would affect the Senate, where the Vice President served as a tie-breaking vote at a critical moment and the Senate itself was intended to represent the interests of the states. The case was supported by 17 states and more than 120 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nHowever, despite Texas's ample arguments, the Supreme Court ruled 7-2 to dismiss the case, saying that Texas \"did not have standing to sue.\" The ruling sparked outrage among many who felt that their claims had not yet been fairly heard in court and saw it as an attempt by the court to avoid a major decision. With legal avenues running out, President Trump called on the Republican Party to challenge the election results on January 6 and demand that the Republican electoral votes in several disputed states be counted."
 usa.24.a: "Even the judicial system is deeply corrupt!"
 usa.24.b: "The judicial system remains neutral!"

 usa.29.t: "State of the Union"
 usa.29.d: "This year's State of the Union address was very interesting. As usual, President Trump showed off his administration's accomplishments since his last State of the Union address and invited many people he believes have been positively impacted by his policies, most notably [VEN.GetNameDef] Interim President Juan Guaidó. The President also announced a dialogue with [PRC.GetLeader] on containing the coronavirus, attempting to ease concerns about the growing outbreak in China. At the end of the speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shredded his speech behind him, leaving many Republicans furious and Democrats indifferent. However, the speech was generally well received and told our people that America is on the road to prosperity."
 usa.29.a: "Pelosi didn't even read it!"
 usa.29.b: "Trump is full of lies!"
 usa.31.t: "Trump becomes legitimate president"
 usa.31.d: "Officially, the electors from the states have voted, Congress has reached a consensus, and everything has settled. Despite the twists and turns, President Donald Trump will remain in office for his second term, to the disappointment of his political opponents. Before this, even Trump's Vice President Mike Pence had almost lost confidence in him and chose to count the ballots sent by the governors against Trump's wishes. However, after the uproar, Congress counted the votes again and found that many were fraudulent or invalid, giving Trump a narrow victory.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people who support the president took to the streets, while leftists felt betrayed by the courts and may be planning marches and strikes. Others are uneasy about the fraud and media corruption exposed in the election.\n\nThe American system is shaking. Can Trump continue to steer the shaky ship?"
 usa.31.a: "No matter the odds...we will keep America great!"
 usa.31.b: "Deceiving God and deceiving people!"

 usa.26.d: "After all this, we finally did it. We eliminated COVID-19 and drove the foreign virus out of our great country. Now we can return to normal, but will it be so easy? Some doctors think we should wait and see that the new coronavirus will develop into a common flu and circulate cyclically once a year. But for now, it seems that we can finally settle down and live a stable life for a while."

 usa.32.d: "Washington, D.C. - January 20, 2021, Eastern Time\nAfter a historic election, Donald Trump was sworn in again and officially became the 45th President of the United States for a second term.

For safety reasons and in response to the prevention measures of the new crown epidemic, most viewers watched the entire process through live TV.\nSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts once again Trump presided over the swearing-in ceremony for the first time, and under his leadership, Trump solemnly read out the oath required by the Constitution. Subsequently, Trump delivered an inaugural speech, emphasizing the theme of \"Make America Great Again\" and promising to continue to promote his policy agenda: strengthening the border wall, expelling illegal immigrants, distancing himself from NATO, and so on.

 USA_country_summary: "§YCountry Summary§!:\nThe United States of America is described by many as a land of opportunities, wealth, and freedom. A nation that believes no challenge is too great, no mountain too tall, and no risk too discouraging.\n\nAnd after the end of the Cold War America believed that it would find itself as the single most powerful nation on earth. However, it would face many challenges, most of which it was unprepared for. Whether it be a resurgence of old and new enemies or unrest within its borders, America wasn't going to experience the peaceful century it had hoped for, instead, it was facing a new world that had begun to increasingly turn against her as time went on. Combined with an increasingly polarized population and murmurs of a new virus in Wuhan, America must truly stand united, for as Gerald Stanely Lee once said.\n\n\"America is a tune. It must be sung together.\""
