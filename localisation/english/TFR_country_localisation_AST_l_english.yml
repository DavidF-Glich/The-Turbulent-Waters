 AST_a_nation_in_crisis_desc: "The new decade has not been kind to Australia. For decades, fires and drought have consumed the nation. Forests have been ravaged by flame as homes and infrastructure are destroyed in the chaos while farms struggle to get by as water resources in the agricultural heartland of Riviera continue to remain scarce. If the nation is to pull itself out of this mess, a solution to these mounting issues must be found and fast."

However, as the bushfires continue to ravange the east coast, the flames have only compounded on the issue of getting fresh water.

 Australia.0.t: "An Offer of Peace?"
 Australia.0.d: "The war for Australia can be described as going anyway but good for Australia. Casualties were mounting, major military assets were lost, and doubt was beginning to spread within society. Most troublesome were the spreading of doubts and even hopelessness within the Australian government. Where's the US and NATO when you need them?! These were problems that were absolutely terrorizing everyone within the Prime Minister's office, including the Prime minister himself. The last thing that was needed now was internal division to steer Australia's war effort from bad to worse. Unfortunately for all of them, it seemed that such division already came... \nThe Prime Minister was in the main office as usual, sorting through the boatloads of mail that came in for today. Most of it was very routine stuff, but a curious and unusual letter was mailed to the Prime Minister, and it was addressed as from the [AST_get_Penny_Wong_Job_name], Penny Wong. Opening the letter, the Prime Minister expected some more typical bureaucratic requests, but reading the first paragraph of the letter filled the Prime Minister with the sourest feeling. The paragraph, let alone the rest of the letter, was about the war, and it made it absolutely clear on what Mrs. Wong intended to be done regarding its continuation. It read: \n\nIt is now abundantly clear to both me and the rest of this government regarding the direction of the war effort against the Chinese. Even though we have tried our best with everything we had to secure a swift and effective victory, we must recognize the uncomfortable truth at hand. We cannot win this war. Our armed forces have lost too much, the public is up in arms over our failures, and the Chinese still retain the ability to strike with consistent efficacy. That it is all why, regrettably, I am now not just requesting, but demanding, that you sign a treaty with the Chinese to end this terrible conflict. I know that it is a tough decision to make but we must think about the future of this nation which is under threat by continuing this bloody conflict. I am sure that through peace and diplomacy that we can work something out with the Chinese. Why must we continue this aggressive posture with China? I am sure that we can find a common ground as a civilized nation so we may share this sphere of the globe for the sake of... \n\nThe Prime Minister stopped reading and put down the letter, sighed heavily, and picked up a pen on the left side of the desk to write a quick memorandum for the Foreign Ministry. A vacancy was about to open for the position for the [AST_get_Penny_Wong_Job_name]."

 Australia.1.d: "After publicly speaking again in favor of peaceful coexistance with the People's Republic of China this morning, Penny Wong, the former [AST_get_Penny_Wong_Job_name], was shot at point blank range with a homemade pistol. The Police, unable to find the suspect or the weapon immediately following the shooting, found Brett Contrail, a veteran of the war in Taiwan and founding member of the Australian Patriot Front, in a nearby coffee shop with his laptop. Brett, being a founding member of the group that styles itself after the Patriot Front that emerged at the start of the American Civil War, was known to local police for previous petty drug charges. After a brief and rushed search of his hard drive, he was found to have ''multiple files about creating homemade weaponry'', as well as a manifesto praising Thomas Rousseau. \n\nAlthough this case seems cut and dry, many publically have claimed that Australian Police have arrested the wrong man, citing the rushed nature of the search and his service for Australia in the recent war. With a jury already have been decided from rural citizens, the nation awaits their verdict."
