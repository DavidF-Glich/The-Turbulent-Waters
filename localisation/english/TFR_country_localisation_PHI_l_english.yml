 PHI_increasing_chinese_influence_idea: "Increasing Chinese Influence"
 PHI_increasing_chinese_influence_idea_desc: "Ever since President Duterte's attempts at warming relations with the People's Republic of China, Chinese Investment has begun to increase as Chinese Loans are being used to fund the infrastructure programs designed to improve the Philippines, or at least it's image. However, it is criticized by many as a dangerous move that would leave the Philippines vulnerable to subversion by the CCP as the country is having its territorial dispute with China itself."
