 uk.1.d: "Politics was all David had heard for the past several weeks. How couldn't you? It felt like the entire world was ablaze ever since the yanks decided to start shooting each other, and Britain was certainly not fireproof to the inferno blazing across the pond despite all the water. But he figured that at least while he was spending time with his 4 year old son who was engrossed with watching BBC Kids he could savor even the smallest movement away from its constant bombardment. Turns out even this was too much to hope for, as when he was looking over his increasingly difficult to pay bills due to the ever depressing market, the TV transitioned to commercial break. The first one was one he had never seen before, it displayed separate shots of little children all across different war scenes of the US staring gloomily into the camera, faces all covered in dust. A soft spoken woman spat off a tragic sounding statistic "In the past months, over 85% of American children have fallen into food insecurity. With your small donation of just 5 dollars a month you can help end-" David turned off the TV, letting out a small sigh as he gazed at his sons now saddened eyes, handing him the Ipad."
