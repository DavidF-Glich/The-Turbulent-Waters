The worst of these groups are the anarchists who attempt to bastardize the ideas of liberty and freedom to burn down houses. \nThese are no people of ours that desire freedom, they only mean to sow discord, distrust, and disdain among our fair communities of like minded individuals and we must take the utmost protection against this disease of the mind. We must cut this weed out by the root before we may strengthen our movement."

With Libertarianism at the helm of this ship, we shall move towards greatness."

 GMA_Tread_on_the_Snakes_desc:0 "These so called ''Libertarians'' may attempt to protest and decry our corporate authority however in all honestly they mean nothing. The vast majority of Libertarians are forty year old men in armchairs decrying so called injustice. They are a mere roadblock in our way.

With liberty as our guiding principle we shall lead the way for all."
 GMA_Flaws_of_Democracy:0 "The Flaws of Democracy"
 GMA_Flaws_of_Democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is such a fickle thing, there's so many things that can lead to despotism of the highest order with the system. Truly it is one of the most flawed ways of government and we, as a people, must not stand for it. We need to shift the view towards what True Democracy is and that is a free hand to do what we please and to not be shackled down by those in the capital and leading power over us."
 GMA_Protection_for_a_Price:0 "Protection for a Price"
 GMA_Protection_for_a_Price_desc:0 "In world history diplomacy is not what turned nations into empires. It was their military and trials by combat that led them to greatness. If we are to stand on that pedestal among the other great nations it is imperative that our Private Military Contractors, the best of the best in terms of armed forces in this decaying corpse of a nation, must have greater influence over our society and in our daily lives. Our citizens, in due time, will learn to respect our soldiers of fortune."
 GMA_Standardize_Cryptocurrency: "Standardize Cryptocurrency"
 GMA_Standardize_Cryptocurrency_desc: "As true Libertarianism has not been regarded or respected in modern thought. To truly liberate ourselves from the heavy hand of a regulated market we must find other forms of currency. One of these, and very popular at the moment, is Cryptocurrency. This new age currency of the future is unregulated and follows the market. The wonders that this weapon the people have to fight the state with is truly amazing and shall overcome the need for such regulations the Government had in times past. "
 GMA_Restore_the_Continental_Congress: "Restore the Continental Congress"
 GMA_Restore_the_Continental_Congress_desc: "Of course there must be some semblance of assembly so that the people may have a say in the work that we have struggled so very hard to achieve.

By reinstating this crucial organization we will have a greater understanding of what our people need and want to thrive as a society. "
 GMA_The_Price_Of_Liberty: "The Price of Liberty"
 GMA_The_Price_Of_Liberty_desc: "Taxes, for many it looms over them as a form of slavery imposed by the state. They are given no say in what is unfairly forced upon the average citizen. The worst of these nations are socialists who increase taxes for public works nobody will use. However, without funding, our cause will collapse into itself, so we must maintain a figure of a taxing system, regardless of how our supporters may view this move."
 GMA_An_American_Confederation: "An American Confederation"
 GMA_An_American_Confederation_desc: "America under a unified central government has been a terrible scourge on the rights of man. Truly we have been oppressed and ruled over, governed by men who know not of our rights. They rule in their ivory towers and crush our freedom. As Americans we must fight back and show the world that we are not men and women who sit around all day and do nothing to fight against tyranny. We are the underrepresented and we shall have our voices heard!"
 GMA_Abolish_the_Duopoly: "Abolish the Duopoly"
 GMA_Abolish_the_Duopoly_desc: "The freedom of choice is one of the cornerstones of our nation. The Republican and Democrat parties have done nothing but hinder us through the restriction and constriction of choice through our politics. With our new sense of political clarity we must use this opportunity to give political parties a chance. Although we may not agree with some, it would be anathema to our nation to hinder the development of political movements within the nation"
 GMA_Promote_Sovereign_Citizenship: "Promote Sovereign Citizenship"
 GMA_Promote_Sovereign_Citizenship_desc: "For so long we have seen our cause as belittled and disregarded. To be thrown into the dustbin of history as a fantasy. But now, we've truly grown as a nation and as a people. We bestow the rights of the citizens to the highest degree. So much so, we regard each man or woman to act how they so choose. By allowing them the freedom to act we give them a lot of responsibility but, we've made it this far."
 GMA_Our_Companies_First: "Our Company First"

While many may disagree with this tactic, it ensures that the Green Mountain Company stays atop all other individuals who stand in our way."
 GMA_Unify_our_Command_Structures: "Unify our Command Structures"
 GMA_Unify_our_Command_Structures_desc: "By now, many Private Military Companies have taken their claim in what we have conquered and have begun petty squabbles amongst one another for the scraps that remain. This is bad for business for everyone so an agreement has been made to centralize command. We shall work together under the oiligarchy led by the heads of these now corporations and be able to have a stronger state and a stronger workforce."
 GMA_Permit_Execute_Authority: "Permit Execute Authority"
 GMA_Permit_Execute_Authority_desc: "Obviously this has been a very tough changeover for those that disagree with our way of life and our methods. Our soldiers have been accosted one too many times and will be given the right to fight back. Although this measure is temporary as we are in a time of strife, eventually when things get better we will repeal this right given to each and every soldier to strike down and purge the rot from our cities as they see fit."
 GMA_Loyalty_to_the_Paycheck: "Loyalty to the Paycheck"
 GMA_Loyalty_to_the_Paycheck_desc: "It's clear that our men only want two things from us, money and influence. And while a purely transactional relationship is perfectly fine. Money is a very tempting thing for a soldier. And by keeping a hearty and steady line of cash will make them subservient to our will and demands. They will shoot, they will fight, and they will fall for us. And they'll be financially supported all the way there."
 GMA_Velvet_Glove_on_an_Iron_Fist: "A Velvet Glove on an Iron Fist"
 GMA_Velvet_Glove_on_an_Iron_Fist_desc: "Some in the international community have seen our corporatocracy and have admonished it by calling it "despotic" and "a far cry from the United States of old". While these nations might have a worse army than our excellent fighting force, they have friends and resources. Resources that we very much need so by putting up a thinly veiled guise of a so called ''Democratic'' process most other nations will look the other way and give us the opportunity to blend in with the rest of the world."
 GMA_Privatize_Mobilization: "Privatize Mobilization"
 GMA_Privatize_Mobilization_desc: "We will not call the average citizen to fight our wars, they are weak and have no stomach to fight. Thus, by enticing those that want to fight with money and the call to adventure we will have a consistent flow of men willing to fight tooth and nail. As our elite forces are called to serve us, the greenest will be called last and those with the most experience will be mixed with our second rate forces to drive experience. Our business is strong and will be unstoppable on the battlefield."
 GMA_american_nostalgia: "American Nostalgia"
 GMA_american_nostalgia_desc: "Our nation has become what the founding fathers have wanted. And our citizens will understand this. Our founding fathers despised political parties and look where this led us to! We have the collapse of a flawed state. Rotten to the core due to the influence of the two party system. Now we are truly what the founders envisioned for a state. They would all be proud of the hard work we have done to achieve their dreams."

 gma.1.t: "There's a Man in the Woods"
 gma.1.d: "After the capture of Theodore Kaczynski by Environmentalist rebels in Colorado, the Unabomber has yet to be found by any regional patrol or by any loyal patriots. However, reports from our Eastern Garrisons report a squadron of camoflauged individuals firing upon them, before escaping into enemy territory. \nUpon further investigation into local CCTV cameras, we have confirmed that the Unabomber has successfully evaded our forces and left our occupied territories."

 gma.2.t: "Deusen visits M.I.T"
 gma.2.d: "Although his popularity has soared since the unification of New England, Deusen has learned that popularity does not mean immortality. With his most recent attempt to gain the trust of the public and to disuade the propaganda that he was a tyrannical warlord, Deusen stepped onto the green courtyard of what remained of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and began his speech to the large group of tired and disheveled students. \n\n''The future is you! You have no Gods, no mas-'' A man reached into his coat, holding the revolver given to him by his brother before he was executed by anarchist militias for supporting Trump. He pulled his revolver out, squeezing the cold stainless steel shot trigger as the smell of gunpowder exploded into the air."
 gma.2.a: "A Vision Dies"
 gma.3.t: "Articles of Confederation are Signed"
 gma.3.d: "After a year of debating and working together, the Sons of Liberty have produced the New Articles of Confederation and have presented the document to the public. Since the announcement declaring the writing of the Articles a year ago, many Americans who lived under the rule of the Confederation of Free American Republics have awaited patiently to see how this document would shape their lives in the coming decades of Libertarian rule."

 gma.4.t: "A Collective Harvest"
 gma.4.d: "Richard's farm had always been a comfortable, quiet place to reside. He wasn't all too different from people of a rural creed, even for New England; he voted Republican more often than not, was a fan of the Patriots, and was making a decent enough income to ensure that his two daughters would have opportunities later on. Things were doing just fine, mostly.\nThen the nation exploded. Neighbour against neighbour, with every group under the sun trying to carve out a spot in what was once the United States. Regardless as to who he supported, Richard didn't want to announce that support to any side - his family was more important than political differences.\nThen word got around of a group having solidified themselves in his area of Green Mountain. Eventually, that same group had driven up to his farm - dressed in tactical attire and camouflage - approached with their weapons slung. Richard was relieved as it became clear they merely wished to speak with him - introducing themselves as the 'Anarchist Collective' of the Green Mountain range. Richard was largely confused - weren't anarchists the type of people who did all that looting and rioting in the cities? These people were calm and collected, and very respectful - not how the authorities portrayed them at all. In the end, Richard agreed. It's not as if he had much of an option, after all - the farm needed to stay afloat somehow, right? He was just grateful that his new 'rulers' were pleasant enough to not threaten him."

 gma.5.d: "Although the fight to reclaim the continent has been brutal, a hero has arisen from the depths of New England.

 gma.9.d: "Theodore John Kaczynski started off the day very normally at Florence, Colorado penitentiary. Waking up, eating the small, poor quality of food that was given to him as ''breakfast'', and then residing in his cell, or being rotated to do several tasks around the prison.  This was the usual procedure. \nAt this particular moment he was sitting back getting into a new interesting novel the prison library had given to him, when a distant explosion could be heard, slightly rattling his cell and sending a few pieces of the ceiling onto the floor. The next blast was much louder, and suddenly audiable shouting and gunfire could be heard, presumably from down the hallway through the wall. \nFrom outside his cell ted saw one prison guard pull out a glock in a desperate attempt to hold back whatever force was invading the prison, firing 3 shots before being cut down by a wave of machine gun fire. Many inmates began to wildly run through the halls using this opportunity to escape. Theodore saw this all from his cell bars but cynically went back to reading his novel until 3 ragtag militants ran past his cell and jammed open the bars. \n\n''Mr. Kaczynski, consider yourself a free man.'' One man extended his arm out to him. ''You have been liberated by the Green Mountain Anarchist Army.'' Theodore sat there sternly hiding his disbelief until another militant, who looked younger than the age of 20 ran in gleefully with an iPhone in his hand and an AR-15 slung on his back. The militant snapped a photo of Kaczynski as he ran in, forcing him to recoil from the camera flash. The militant continued to hold up his phone and asked Kaczynski in a perky tone, ''Oh my god, ted, Can you say the first lines from your manifesto please??'' \nTed sighed and began to recite the words to entertain the young man as he got up to finally step out of this prison."

 gma.10.d: "Washington DC, the home of the Biden government, has fallen to advancing anarchist militias today. As pandemonium rages throughout the cities, militias have been reported to have been burning down 'symbols of reaction' in revolutionary fervor. The White House itself was seen in flames as a wild mob gathered outside of it, declaring the death of statism. David Van Deusen, the De-Facto leader for the newly proclaimed American Free Territory declared that 'the tyranny over the oppressed people's of America has finally ended. A tide of free spirits have risen up and smashed their chains, a tide that will sweep this nation from the Atlantic to the Pacific'"

Students marched from building to building, shouting chants of 'Down with bourgeois academia!' and 'death to all reactionaries who stand in the way of the people!'.  Teachers and more conservative students were seen hanging from streetposts, with signs labeled 'counterrevolutionary' and 'reactionary' strung on their necks. The fires were left burning for hours with no one to attend to them, and the once renowned university lay smoldering in a pile of ashes."

 gma.15.t: "Collapse of the New England Feds"
 gma.15.d: "As the flames of liberation rage onward throughout the collapsed federal territory of New England, our movement is ecstatic - we have triumphed over the regional statist authority, marking the end of the \"legitimate government\" in the northeast. As we speak, the revenge against the tyrannical entity that has ruled over this place for hundreds of years has been nothing short of extremely satisfying.\n\nCaptured members of the federal command (those who have not already fled) have been more often than not shot dead in the streets, a testament for what the shackled populace should have done a long, long time ago. Those few government legislators still remaining have been targets for humiliation, detainment, and even beatings in some cases, with the worst offenders meeting similar fates to their militaristic counterparts.\n\nOur victory against the government has shown large numbers of statist POW's, largely consisting of National Guardsmen foolish enough to try and resist the tide, yet smart enough to surrender once it was over. Despite some harsh treatment by angry militiamen, they are without a doubt kept under close watch in an effort to ensure that they don't attempt to join the pathetic remnant holdouts - not that it has any chance to succeed, of course. \n\nFor now, however, we must work to secure these territories for communal integration. Many of the common people here have been mentally poisoned by statist propaganda, and they often fear and despise the brave militias vandalizing the monuments to their suffering. This must, and will, change overtime - they'll soon realize how beneficial this shakeup of the status quo will be to their lives."

 gma.29.d: "Having been determined in the rhetoric and speeches by what he now called his comrades, Lyndon was accustomed to usual ruffness engaged within his own platoon, which was what he thought his brother Jonathan, a highschool dropout who couldn't even lift his younger sister if he was forced to, needed in order to prove his manhood. And, although hesitant at first to join in with the group, fearing the possibility of death, Jonathan was now a fearless and rising star within the platoon, putting his thousands of hours on Call of Duty to good use. \nOn an obligatory night patrol, going as easy as most of the other nights, since most of their enemies were either crushed or had fled into Canada or Unionist territories, most of the platoon expected to drink beer and watch the treeline for any creature that wanted to become tomorrows rations, though they were all disheartened to hear a call from their commander from their walkie talkies to get off their asses and head back to HQ. \nAs they approached the camp, there were chants that could be faintly heard from afar, though as the nightwatch got closer, Lyndon could make out the words ''Lynch. the. Fed'' repeated aggnosium. With the chants becoming ever more impactful, there was a silence that fell on the camp as they were noticed. \nThat's when it hit him who the rat was. \n\nStanding at the edge of the makeshift gallows, Jonathan, quivering and pale after being beaten and battered by what appeared to be a baseball bat, now had a noose tied tightly around his neck. Their commander reading from a list of crimes that Jonathan had been accused of. Lyndon watched in horror as his brother was accused of being an undercover Fed working to subvert the group from within, and, before he could even muster the words to defend his brother, the latch was pulled, and his brother, screaming and gasping for air, dangled off of the sturdy branch he had been tied to until... Silence."

He was still visibly shaken, having been beaten and thrown around like a ragdoll by the organisation which he had once called his own. \n\nHis previous role, the rain, the destroyed buildings, none of this would matter, however, as his fate was set and sealed, with rain pouring down his cheeks, and the muffled chanting of the crowd, who had presupposed their own delight to hear the already decided conviction of guilt that had been read by the 20-year-old playing Judge, Jury and Executioner, before pointing the his .357 Magnum to David's head, and reading out an almost biblical quote, although in a twisted sense of the word."

 gma.54.d: "Hello, Doctor Garcia.\nAs requested, I have delivered a copy of patient 8045-6356's diagnosis.\n\nPatient showed signs of extreme weakness and exhaustion and abnormal weight loss, due to the current circumstances where this would have been attributed to high amounts of stress due to sudden political and military involvement which both affect body and mind, however when frequent loss of consciousness occurred to the patient, concerns were raised as he was admitted into medical care.\nAfter careful review of symptoms and a analysis of his biopsy samples, it was convoluted that the patient had a mild case of skin cancer, aggravated by the recent developments, more specifically basal-cell carcinoma, currently it is in stage four which means that the cancer has grown in size and has spread to nearby lymph nodes, It has also spread to areas outside the skin, such as to distant organs like the brain.\n\nPossible causative factors; Aged 79, Nevada is known for its sunny weather, patient, lived a life outdoors with no sunscreen, a weakened immune system due to powerful antidepressant medication he took, stress and prison food. \nWith this diagnosis and the severity of the cancer it has been concluded that the patient has approximately 10 months left. It is recommended that the patient ceases any activity that causes major strain on his body and mind, as well as to avoid stressful situations as much as possible. \n\nSincerely,\nDoctor Heartwell"

 gma.56.d: "Friday \n\nI buried Teddy today. We were out hiking the mountains of New Hampshire when he requested to stop and rest for the night. When I awoke, he was outside, staring up at the sky, but when I called his name and he didn't move, I knew he was gone. \n\nNothing could have been done to save him. His time had run out and he was again once with nature. I carried him to the top of the mountain and laid a crude gravestone right above his head. He had always talked of the Sky Burials of the people of Tibet, and returning to the Earth after death. I said my goodbyes to him, and scaled down the mountain alone. \n\nTeddy talked about how death was a common occurrence and that he shouldn't be treated with the reverence of a god but, how could we not? Teddy was a friend, a leader, and a father to me. I will miss Him, and the Vanguard will use His legacy as a guidepost to do away with the corruption of modernity. He started this movement, He led us to greatness.  Now He's gone, but His movement is still here. \n\nWe have had protocols in place within the Vanguard since his diagnosis, I have my duties. It is up to my compatriots to follow-up on their ends of those protocols. We cannot risk losing the progress we have made towards a new society because of individualistic ideologues and petty squabbles, but I fear that we may..."

 gma.591.a: "A great annoyance. Or perhaps a great oppurtunity?"
 gma.591.d: "With the Second American Civil War in full swing, piracy has become rampant all across the continent. Former Seamen have raised the black flag on our behalf, as they discover that their Naval checks are bouncing or simply not ever arriving. The conflict on the Continent has thus inadvertently ushered in a Second Golden Age of piracy on the waves."
 gma.63.t: "Year Zero"
 gma.63.a: "A new cycle, full of vigor"
 gma.63.d: "The sun is shining in the deep forests of America, away from the concrete, away from the metallic towers, away from the artificial and the digital. \nHere the trees stand tall, feeling the gentle winds, the flowers bloom and the bees buzz with delight, no worry in the world except for its own hive, contributing to nature's cycle. Unfortunately, none of the people standing in the forest were at peace, some have been busy representing their region, while others were committed to command and oversee the militia's, however for this moment all of them were needed, in the back a single person was filming with an hand camera, it was necessary that whatever Kaczynski had to say would be reported. \nKaczynski wasn't the best at public speaking, his time in prison surely contributed to that, hence why he thought it would be better if only his most trusted were present and that his upcoming speech would be recorded and distributed to the people, he let out a sigh as he stepped on a wooden podium, overlooking at his most loyal men and women who know what is at stake, and the drastic measures that need to be taken, he adjusted his clothes and began to speak. \n''When the first human walked on Earth it coexisted with nature, eating what was needed, using what was needed, it was part of the natural cycle of life and death, we contributed and gave birth to offspring so they could repeat that cycle, it was balanced and harmonious. \nNow however, Man has detached itself from this cycle, consuming more than it needs, the animals run from the machine of humanity, the green beauty withers and dies due to the cocktail of chemicals hanging in the air, so much human potential has been lost in the concrete cities, so many have lost their minds there, with the old cycle destroyed, time has stopped, stagnation continues as the ivory tower grows.\nA new cycle must be made, where we grow together with what Earth provides, where we will not make the same mistakes as we did previously, the world starts again, this is the first year of a new humanity, we are the pioneers of a new age and with that i officially declare year zero, no more shall we be held back by the burdens of the past, all we can do is move forwards, so move forwards i tell you!''"
 gma_news.1.t: "Anarchists Sieze Boston"
 gma_news.1.d: "The region of New England has been largely contested between various groups and factions since the beginning of the civil war that has plagued the United States for some time now. With the largely collapsed authority of the region, fighting has been considerably fierce between those very contenders - and it appears to have finally taken a decisive turn, albeit in a way that few people could have expected.\n Reports from the city of Boston have trickled in as extremely harsh fighting within the city has come to a close, with eyewitness accounts claiming that anarchist militias have finally managed to gain decisive control over the city. The loosely organized 'Green Mountain Anarchist Collective' have announced that the city has been \"liberated\" from the clutches of fascist statism, with the announcement relayed by their de-facto leader, David Van Deusen. Already, widespread looting and the destruction of \"statist imagery and symbolism\" have been reported as the GMAC celebrate their unforeseen victory."

 gma_news.2.d: "Following weeks of fighting, the anarchist group known as the Association of the Freed have united New England, defeating both federalist and fascist forces alike. News of a revolutionary reorganization of society have come out of the area, with the Anarchist Collective shaping New England society in their image. Satellite Intelligence has shown militias gathering on the border of the Union of America, showing worrying signs of the conflict spilling over into the greater American Civil War."

 gma_news.3.t: "Anarchists Emerge Victorious in America"
 gma_news.3.d: "In a suprising twist of events, the group formerly known as the Association of the Freed have won the Second American Civil War. Starting as a small guerilla force in Vermont, the Anarchist Collective defeated its enemies in the Patriot Front and the New England Federal Forces before engaging in intense fighting against the Union of America in New York. Famous for their use of guerilla tactics and democraticized military, few expected a radical group to come in power in America. Stories of mob violence, looting and general lack of order have been spread to international observers, as the world holds its breath to see how the new masters of America will rule the nation."

 gma_news.4.t: "Anarchists Take New York!"
 gma_news.4.d: "Not long after the second American Civil War began, the city of New York's state of considerable unrest remained ever-present as the conflict raged onward. Massive rioting was commonplace regardless of who controlled the city, with its inhabitants ever divided between whom they supported, if any belligerent at all. Groups such as the Proud Boys and militias aligned with the Communist Party of the USA repeatedly fought for the mantle of the Big Apple.\nIt appears that such a mantle goes to the New England Free Territory, who after securing their region from their home in Green Mountain, have managed to capture the city after catastrophic fighting. Anarchist militias euphorically celebrate their symbolic victory over the high-rise city as widespread looting and vandalism have been reported in its wake. Places such as the New York Stock Exchange and the already-burnt NYPD headquarters have been the main targets for celebratory destruction. While the city remains in unrest, it appears that the anarchist movement has tamed it, for the time being." 
 gma_news.5.t: "Anarchists Take Richmond"
 gma_news.5.d: "The city of Richmond has long since been wrought with unrest, even before the outbreak of civil war. Armed protests were common throughout the historic city, ranging from disputes over the election results to legislature regarding the second amendment. Being a rather pro-Trump state in and of itself, the Biden administration found it increasingly difficult to maintain law and order within the city.\n\nAs of today, however, that order has been replaced with anarchy. After heavy clashes within the city, the right-wing militias have buckled under the weight of the American Free Territory as anarchist forces have largely secured the city, outside of some stubborn holdouts. Post-battle celebration is currently being held as Richmond appears to be a prime target for symbolic destruction, with still-standing monuments of Confederate leaders that were not forcibly removed before the war have faced destruction, vandalism, and makeshift removals of their own. The anarchist militias involved have appeared to take great pride and interest in defacing monuments that could even possibly imply sympathy towards the old Confederacy, much to the chagrin of those mainly right-wingers who consider it to be \"erasing history\"."

 gma_news.6.t: "The American Envoy"
 gma_news.6.d: "With the growing power of the Vanguard of the Wild in the Second American Civil War it would have been a matter of time before this group would make appearances globally, however not many expected an envoy to be sent to the United Nations, with recent concerns of extreme undemocratic activity, the Assembly were ready to ask burning questions to the envoy, with the most prominent one being ''why?''. \nThe envoy responded calmly to these questions, stating that the mistakes of the past won't be repeated again, that the lands won't be soiled by chemicals anymore, that the waters will return to the purity it was once, that the endless corporate machines won't corrupt nature and humanity ever again and if sacrifices had to be made then so be it, following that the envoy stated that he encourages the rest of the world to follow the footsteps of the vanguard, to deindustrialize and to return to the perfect harmony of nature itself. \nEventually the envoy was booed off the stage, with several representatives of different nations denouncing the Vanguard and assuring that the undermining of democratic values and human lifes won't go unpunished, however with current developments around the world it is questioned whether these threats hold any ground."
