 turkey.2.t: "Turkey Leaves NATO"
 turkey.2.d: "In the aftermath of the election that was barely won by Erdogan, he accused NATO countries in meddling in Turkish internal affairs. In his speech Erdogan called NATO a "defunct and de-facto dead organization", also noting that the absence of the United States has affected that, and pledged to withdraw Turkish NATO membership."
 turkey.2.a: "Is he serious?"
 turkey.3.t: "Erdogan Re-elected in Turkey"
 turkey.3.d: "Damn it, he found out we were trying to sack him and now he's leaving NATO!"
 turkey.3.a: "Scheiße!"
 turkey.4.t: "Kemal Kilicdaroglu Elected in Turkey"
 turkey.4.d: "Thankfully, our very democratic incursion into Turkish internal affairs has paid off! Waiting for the Kemalist subideology."
 turkey.4.a: "No country is free unless it is democratic."
