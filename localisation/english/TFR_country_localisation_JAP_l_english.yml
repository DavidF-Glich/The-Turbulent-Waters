 JAP_research_the_vaccine_desc: "Ever since the Covid-19 pandemic slammed our country, the question on everyone's minds has been "can we make a vaccine?"

 JAP_provide_emergency_response_packages: "Provide Emergency Response Packages"
 JAP_provide_emergency_response_packages_desc: "Covid-19 is quite possibly the greatest threat we have faced since the end of the Second World War. Across the country, our people are suffering from a lack of just about everything. It is our responsibility to ensure they get the goods they need."
 JAP_continue_the_lockdowns: "Continue the Lockdowns"
 JAP_continue_the_lockdowns_desc: "While it is unfortunate that we must go against the will of the people, it is for their sake. We are still losing thousands of Japanese lives to this damned virus, and we are unwilling to let even more innocents die. The lockdowns will be continued indefinitely. "
 JAP_ease_the_lockdowns: "Ease the Lockdowns"
 JAP_ease_the_lockdowns_desc: "The people's desire is to be free from the prison of their homes, and it is one we can sympathize with. While we are not ready to go back to pre-Covid life, we can at the very least lessen some of the restrictions we have been forcing on our civilians."
 JAP_support_small_medium_enterprises: "Support Small-Medium Enterprises"
 JAP_support_small_medium_enterprises_desc: "The foundations of capitalism lie not on giant, hulking corporations, but on small businesses. In the Japan of today, it seems this has been forgotten. Smaller enterprises need our support now more than ever, especially with the threat of Covid-19 taking away their business."
 JAP_prepare_for_the_olympics: "Prepare for the Olympics"
 JAP_prepare_for_the_olympics_desc: "For nearly seven years, our Capital has been eagerly awaiting the Olympics. Yet, on the eve of this momentous occasion, our nation was struck by the same virus as the rest of the world. This, combined with the uptick in tension across the globe, has made organizers rethink the event. With the fear of Covid-19, and sparks flying between competitors, the question has come forward of if Tokyo is in any sort of state to host the Olympics."
 JAP_hold_the_olympics: "Hold the Olympics"
 JAP_hold_the_olympics_desc: "In these trying times, how better to heal the globe than with some friendly competition? Virus and rivalries be damned, these Olympics will be focused on bringing people together! The risks are not great enough to stop us from showing the world the true meaning of hospitality."
 JAP_delay_the_olympics: "Delay the Olympics"
 JAP_delay_the_olympics_desc: "Despite our eagerness to host the Olympics, we must admit there are too many unknown variables. A doping scandal, for instance, could have severe consequences thanks to global tensions. While extremely unlikely, a fight between athletes could be devastating. Not to mention the threat of a super spreader event. The decision has been made to delay the games until 2021."
 JAP_promote_japanese_culture: "Promote Japanese Culture"
 JAP_promote_japanese_culture_desc: "Katanas, Bonsai Trees, Doujinshi, Anime, Sushi, and, Tempura. We get to promote our culture across the world, and we could do it better."

 JAP_provide_maternity_leave_for_female_workers_desc: "With the birth rate declining in our country, it is well within our best interests to ensure that women can actually take care of their babies. Too many of our own citizens do not have access to maternity leave, and that must change!"
 JAP_improve_childcare_facilities: "Improve Childcare Facilities"
 JAP_improve_childcare_facilities_desc: "Mothers and fathers within our nation often spend much of their day at work, and do not have time to take care of their children. Our childcare facilities are functional, but if we want to take pressure off our people, we must ensure they are extraordinary!"

 JAP_improve_the_workspace_desc: "Whether it's a toxic boss, or a construction site that hasn't been inspected in one too many years, our people often face a less than desirable workplace. With the way the world is going, we need to encourage a healthy, safe, and fun work environment!"

 JAP_ease_economic_burdens_desc: "Spending policies do not come cheap, and inevitably, the economy will suffer.

 JAP_tackle_the_hikkikomori_issue: "Tackle the Hikkikomori Issue"
 JAP_tackle_the_hikkikomori_issue_desc: "The idea of hikikomori is an interesting one, and one that plagues our nation. While introverts are socially acceptable, sealing yourself in your room for life is not. Every hikikomori is a person who is not contributing to society, and who is burdening the people around them. This issue must be resolved immediately."
 JAP_reform_the_education_system: "Reform the Education System"
 JAP_reform_the_education_system_desc: "Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither was Japan. When our education system got as messed up as it is today is lost to history, but its current state is quite undesirable. If we want to ensure our children grow up healthy and smart, then reform is incredibly overdue."
 JAP_revise_article_9: "Revise Article 9"
 JAP_revise_article_9_desc: "Article 9 of our constitution effectively states that we may have no standing army. Now, this is where a problem arises, as how will we fight without an army? Luckily we've managed to find a few loopholes, but they are only so wide, and so now we must finally revise this outdated piece of our nation's codex."
 JAP_improve_the_ground_defence_forces: "Improve the Ground Defence Forces"
 JAP_improve_the_ground_defence_forces_desc: "While it seems unlikely we will face China on the ground, who knows? Taiwan seems the most likely place for a face-to-face confrontation, but if things go poorly we may have to face the dragon on our own soil. With the revisions to Article 9, we can finally build up a stronger ground force."
 JAP_improve_the_tank_fleet: "Improve the Tank Fleet"
 JAP_improve_the_tank_fleet_desc: "Japan doesn't have a great history when it comes to tanks, and that's because throughout history we've never really had to use them. However, the battlefield of today features these behemoths on treads much more frequently, and so we must be able to match the Chinese in this field."
 JAP_a_fleet_of_mcvs: "A fleet of MCVs"
 JAP_a_fleet_of_mcvs_desc: "Tanks tend to be slow and hard to repair and replace, fortunately we have an alternative. The MCV, while not packing as much firepower, is fast and versatile, and will surely be able to deal devastating blows to our enemies."
 JAP_innovate_the_helicopter_fleet: "Innovate the Helicopter Fleet"
 JAP_innovate_the_helicopter_fleet_desc: "With the likeliness of island and jungle warfare being high, the necessity for a large helicopter fleet is even higher. Not only do we need many, however, but they must be modern enough to go toe-to-toe with the Chinese."

 JAP_adapt_to_cyber_warfare_desc: "We will be the first to admit the Chinese got a head start on us when it comes to cyber warfare, unfortunately for them, we are catching up. The internet is a new front that requires our utmost attention, and will be utilized to its full extent."
 JAP_acquire_f35s: "Acquire F-35s"
 JAP_acquire_f35s_desc: "With the USA embroiled in internal strife, the prospect of us securing F-35s from anywhere seems absurd. Fortunately, we have our ways, and we will ensure that the skies above the Pacific will belong to us only!"
 JAP_expand_the_JMSDF: "Expand the JMSDF"
 JAP_expand_the_JMSDF_desc: "As an island nation, a strong maritime force is required. The high seas is also where we're more likely to engage with our Chinese rivals in the inevitable future conflict. This war will come sooner than later, and so we must expand the JMSDF as fast as we can, without sacrificing quality of course"
 JAP_convert_helicopter_destroyers: "Convert Helicopter Destroyers"
 JAP_convert_helicopter_destroyers_desc: "Our navy, unfortunately, does not have any aircraft carriers. Carriers are large, expensive, and up until now we were banned from having them. What we do have, however, are helicopter carriers that can converted to carry some types of aircraft."
 JAP_build_new_aegis_destroyers: "Build new Aegis Destroyers"
 JAP_build_new_aegis_destroyers_desc: "Destroyers employing the use of the Aegis system are some of the most advanced in the world, and we are lucky enough to have our hands on some. However in the case of war with China, the few we do have will not be enough, and so more must be constructed."
 JAP_unveil_the_taigei: "Unveil the Taigei"
 JAP_unveil_the_taigei_desc: "The time has come for Japan to join the ranks of nations with next-gen submarines, and so our researchers have come up with the Taigei. While not the best in the world, the Taigei class will certainly reinforce the JMSDF's presence under the waves."
 JAP_build_new_dockyards: "Build New Dockyards"
 JAP_build_new_dockyards_desc: "As we continue mass production of new naval assets, we find our dockyards constantly backed up with new orders. Constructing more will not only create new jobs, but also increase the rate at which we churn out new ships and subs."
 JAP_introduce_the_kawazaki: "Improve Kawasaki P-1"
 JAP_introduce_the_kawazaki_desc: "The Chinese like being subtle when they infiltrate our national waters, and it's often up to the Kawasaki P-1 to chase them out. We will improve this aircraft so that it's capable of traveling further away and spotting Chinese vessels from even greater distances."
 JAP_improve_island_defences: "Improve Island Defences"
 JAP_improve_island_defences_desc: "China will no doubt attempt to destroy our island bases, be it by missile barrage or naval invasion. No matter how they choose to do it, we must ensure that it's incredibly difficult for them."
 JAP_procure_new_equipment: "Procure New Equipment"
 JAP_procure_new_equipment_desc: "Even if America is busy with its own internal, "politic," we have other allies around the globe from which we can procure weapons. We will reach out to our comrades across the world and purchase new equipment to better our fighting forces."
 JAP_start_limited_military_exports: "Start Limited Military Exports"
 JAP_start_limited_military_exports_desc: "Taiwan and Australia, while our respected allies, have not been innovating their military to the extent we have. As such, to ensure they can help us fight China as well as possible, we will begin supplying them with some of our best equipment."
 JAP_new_artillery_pieces: "New Artillery Pieces"
 JAP_new_artillery_pieces_desc: "China's defense doctrine seems to rely heavily on artillery, as if they intend to solely sit and pound us with shells from their own shores. Well, two can play at that game."
 
 #Election Tree
 JAP_election_time: "Election Time"
 JAP_election_time_desc: "It's that time again, a special moment that comes once every four years. This upcoming election promises to be one of the most contentious and intriguing elections in our nation's history, as the candidates deal with all kinds of different issues. Luckily, it doesn't seem it will be as controversial as America's latest election."
 JAP_unite_against_ldp: "Unite Against the LDP"
 JAP_unite_against_ldp_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party has ruled Japan almost continuously for the past 75 years. It has obviously had its ups and downs in that time, but these past few years seem to fall steadily into the latter category. It will be a Herculean task to knock the LDP off its throne, but with a bit of luck, and a lot of negotiations, it will be possible."
 JAP_for_prosperity_of_our_people: "For the Prosperity of Our People"
 JAP_for_prosperity_of_our_people_desc: "There's a saying, "Japan has been living in the year 2000 since 1980." Our people have access to a number of fancy gadgets, but what good are those when they can hardly afford them? The LDP rules like we are still living in the future, when many of our people were left behind decades ago. We will smash the status quo, and bring prosperity to everyone!"
 JAP_for_saving_our_economy: "For Saving Our Economy"
 JAP_for_saving_our_economy_desc: "The Japanese economic miracle ended nearly three decades ago, yet the LDP rules as if the music is still blaring. We can't sit idly by and watch as they do nothing to save our crashing economy, we must put our foot down and take matters into our own hands!"
 JAP_form_civil_coalition: "Form the Civil Coalition"
 JAP_form_civil_coalition_desc: "It would literally be impossible for one party to take down the LDP, but a coalition, that's where the magic happens. We will unite the Japanese people by uniting our parties into a coalition capable of representing them in the government!"
 JAP_destroy_myth_of_one_party_japan: "Destroy the Myth of the One-Party Japan"
 JAP_destroy_myth_of_one_party_japan_desc: "When something has remained practically unchanged since the birth of your grandparents, it seems like that's how things will always be. But it doesn't have to be that way. Age-old political stereotypes are changing around the globe on a weekly basis, and it's time Japanese politics joined them."
 JAP_covid_populism: "COVID Populism"
 JAP_covid_populism_desc: "[JAP_covid_populism_scripted_loc]"
 JAP_covid_populism_cc: "The Liberal Democratic Party managed the pandemic horribly, and thousands of Japanese citizens lie in their grave as a result. They claim that we have no experience governing the country, and as such will not know how to deal with the ongoing pandemic. Whether or not this is true, at the very least, we know what not to do."
 JAP_covid_populism_ldp: "While many say we could have handled the Covid Pandemic better, technically everything can always be done better. We did the best with what we had. More importantly, however, is that the Civil Coalition has no experience with anything like Covid as they've never had a chance to properly govern the nation. The pandemic is still ongoing, and putting a bunch of newbies in charge doesn't seem like the best idea."
 JAP_restore_peoples_trust: "Restore the People's Trust"
 JAP_restore_peoples_trust_desc: "Our party has stumbled, it has tripped, and it has fallen. But what else has it always done? Gotten back up. The Liberal Democratic Party has always been there for the Japanese people, and we will not be removed by a group of fringe parties that will tear themselves to shreds the moment they take power."
 JAP_good_old_japan: "Good Old Japan"
 JAP_good_old_japan_desc: "Japan has a culture that has developed over thousands of years, and while yes, things have changed, we have always remained steadfast in our values. A little hiccup in our nation's history is not enough to make us forget everything we stand for. "
 JAP_new_course: "A New Course"
 JAP_new_course_desc: "Japan has changed so much in the past century, and it will surely change even more in the next one. We have seen how discontent the people are with the current party politics, and leadership has realized things must change. Out with the old, and in with the new, as they say."
 JAP_strengthen_our_union: "Strengthen Our Union"
 JAP_strengthen_our_union_desc: "While we don't rely on the Komeito Party, they are our long standing ally, and their support is deeply appreciated. As the so-called "Civil Coalition" scrounges together more and more small parties, we must consolidate our own allies, Komeito especially."
 JAP_maintain_stability: "Maintain Stability"
 JAP_maintain_stability_desc: "Above all else, our party has always stood for stability. Change may be necessary in some areas, but that doesn't mean it needs to come tomorrow. The Liberal Democratic Party will see Japan's smooth transition into the future, as it has for decades, and will forever."
 
 #Civil Coalition Tree
 JAP_formation_of_government: "Form a Government"
 JAP_formation_of_government_desc: "When someone calls something a “Herculean task” they're usually referring to something that should be, by all means, impossible. However, Hercules still completed his 12 labors, and we have completed our one. The LDP has finally been dethroned, and now we must set about certifying our control."
 JAP_expose_ldp: "Expose the LDP"
 JAP_expose_ldp_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party is famous for scandals. Unfortunately, since they controlled the government for so long, many of their crimes never saw the light of day. Now that we control the country, however, we will ensure the people see the full extent of their trespasses."
 JAP_state_budgeting: "State Budgeting"
 JAP_state_budgeting_desc: "The LDP trashed the Japanese economy, and we have no intention to follow in their footsteps. We want to set a good example early, and to do that we must ensure the budget is small, clean, and effective."
 JAP_lets_do_our_best: "Let's Do Our Best!"

 JAP_free_japan: "A Free Japan"
 JAP_free_japan_desc: "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness. This is what it says all people are entitled to in the constitution of one of our greatest allies. Why should that be limited to them? Should not all people, across the globe be entitled to these? In Japan, our people certainly are, and we will fight to defend them!"

 JAP_form_pdto: "Form the PDTO"
 JAP_form_pdto_desc: "With the USA crippled across the Pacific, the Chinese Dragon has begun hungrily eying our allies in the South China Sea, Taiwan especially. We are eager to defend them, and we are not alone. Australia has also deemed China a significant threat, and so our three nations have agreed to form an alliance. The Pacific Defense Treaty Organization will be based off of NATO, but for the Pacific, and will have the goal of deterring Chinese aggression."
 JAP_pledge_to_defend_taiwan: "Pledge to Defend Taiwan"
 JAP_pledge_to_defend_taiwan_desc: "The hungry jaws of the People's Republic of China look to snatch up Taiwan and tear it shreds. Unfortunately for them, as long as we stand, we will defend the sovereignty of our sister nation and the dragon will remain caged to the mainland!"
 JAP_anti_prc_propaganda: "Anti-PRC Propaganda"
 JAP_anti_prc_propaganda_desc: "There aren't many Japanese who like the PRC, but everyday our enemy converts a few more people to their cause. Through the use of apps like TikTok, they brainwash our youth into supporting their cause! Fortunately, two can play the propaganda game, and we are very determined to one up them."
 JAP_beyond_the_ocean: "Beyond the Ocean"
 JAP_beyond_the_ocean_desc: "Our old rival turned greatest benefactor finds itself in a time of crisis. Two old men have carved up a 250 year old nation and are currently fighting each other with everything they've got. The question facing us is, who should we side with?"
 JAP_support_small_business: "Support Small Businesses"
 JAP_support_small_business_desc: "Who doesn't like a small business? Whether it's a cozy little tea shop down the street from your house, or a family owned grocery store dating back who knows how many years, they always leave impressions on people. The Covid pandemic forced many to close, but there are still many around, and we are happy to help them!"
 JAP_strengthen_freedom_of_speech: "Strengthen Freedom of Speech"
 JAP_strengthen_freedom_of_speech_desc: "Our nation already has strong freedom of speech, but there are still certain things that people can get in trouble for. If we are to join the ranks of other modern democracies, we need to update the things our people can say."
 JAP_protect_rights_of_citizens: "Protect Rights of Citizens"
 JAP_protect_rights_of_citizens_desc: "Everyone has the same rights as everyone else, poor or rich, male or female, or anything other difference between us. Yet there are those who don't see it that way, and would like nothing more than to subjugate others. This will not stand here, and we will protect the rights of all Japanese citizens!"
 JAP_loyal_liberal_democrats: "Ours in the LDP"
 JAP_loyal_liberal_democrats_desc: "With our victory in the 2021 elections, the rotten structure of the Liberal Democratic Party came toppling down. Our coalition matched the ideology of many people within the LDP, and these "dissidents" came flocking over. Perhaps their biggest defeat, however, was the loss of the Komeito party. It seems like the LDP will not put a prime minister in charge of Japan any time soon."
 JAP_post_covid_stabilization: "Post-COVID Stabilization"
 JAP_post_covid_stabilization_desc: "As the heat finally quells from the Covid pandemic, we must use the time we have to bring the people together. The economy can wait for a bit, for it means nothing if our people are at each other's throats"
 JAP_promote_gender_neutrality: "Promote Gender Equality"
 JAP_promote_gender_neutrality_desc: "It's the 2020s, for crying out loud, and yet gender inequality in our nation remains unnecessarily high. If we are to come off as a strong, united nation, all of our people must be equally strong and united!"
 JAP_green_revolution: "A Green Revolution"
 JAP_green_revolution_desc: "Japan has never been well renowned for our production of fossil fuels, and for good reason. As the world grows increasingly polarized, and with the USA out of the picture, it is paramount we don't become reliant on anyone else.

 JAP_innovation_straight_away: "Innovation Straight Away"
 JAP_innovation_straight_away_desc: "We in the Innovation Party have seized the initiative and managed to certify control over the government.

 JAP_harmonious_society: "Harmonious Society"
 JAP_harmonious_society_desc: "Japan must be a nation of peace at home, and strength abroad. While the Liberal Democratic Party was a fan of advocating for stability, we advocate for more than that, we advocate for harmony. When people work in unison, great things are easily achievable."
 JAP_bring_the_left_back: "Bring The Left Back"
 JAP_bring_the_left_back_desc: "Our nation does not have a good history of working with the left, and the Taiwan war showed that. Despite our victory, many on the left were strongly against the war. Where others see “communist agitators,” we see an opportunity for more votes, and so we will work to bring the left back into the fold."
 JAP_additional_welfare: "Additional Welfare"

 JAP_grassroots_democracy: "Grassroots Democracy"
 JAP_grassroots_democracy_desc: "Democracy, at its core, is a way for the people to peacefully get what they want. Yet in today's world, this has been forgotten by too many nations, and one wealthy business mogul could have more influence than a thousand voters. We must ensure there's no funny business in our democracy, and that we represent only the will of the people."
 JAP_the_future_of_tokyo: "The Future of Tokyo"
 JAP_the_future_of_tokyo_desc: "Life in the city can be bleak, and at times, depressing. But you know what never gets old? The smell of fresh air, and beautiful nature. However as more and more people move to the cities, especially Tokyo, less get to experience this. We need to get the rural population back up, and offering some monetary compensation is not beneath us."
 JAP_cultural_diversity: "Cultural Diversity"
 JAP_cultural_diversity_desc: "Japan has a cultural divide, not between two groups of people, but between the old and the new. The culture of the modern era is nearly unrecognizable to that of a century ago, and people often have a hard time choosing which to embrace. However, it's not one or the other, the beautiful thing about culture is that anyone can enjoy it! "
 JAP_legacy_of_ldp: "Legacy of LDP"

 JAP_marriage_reform: "Marriage Reform"
 JAP_marriage_reform_desc: "We claim to be a modern nation, yet our marriage code is incredibly backwards and ancient. We will join our Taiwan brother in recognition of same-sex marriage. The other issue is the problem of separate surnames, which will now be given."
 JAP_accessible_education: "Accessible Education"
 JAP_accessible_education_desc: "A problem too many Japanese people find themselves facing is their inability to afford education. How can we be considered a modern nation if our people aren't even educated? We will take the necessary steps towards cheap, and even free, education."
 JAP_continue_environmentalism: "Continue Environmentalism"
 JAP_continue_environmentalism_desc: "Our rival, China, is infamous for having terrible pollution in and around their cities.

 JAP_integrate_democrat_dissidents_desc: "The Democratic Party For the People is a small one, but it has many of our same goals. While integrating it won't give us any massive advantages, any additions to the party are good ones."
 JAP_small_government: "Small Government"
 JAP_small_government_desc: "After decades of the LDP and their hulking abomination of a party, many are against the idea of a large government. We agree with this, and some downsizing is certainly necessary."
 JAP_japanese_federalism: "Japanese Federalism"
 JAP_japanese_federalism_desc: "Federalism and Japan have most likely never been put together in the same sentence.

 JAP_promotion_of_free_trade_desc: "We have many allies in the Asia-Pacific region who will happily trade their goods with us. By loosening the restrictions on free trade, it will be a win-win situation for everyone!"
 JAP_digitalisation_of_bureaucracy: "Digitalisation of Bureaucracy"
 JAP_digitalisation_of_bureaucracy_desc: "Thanks to the LDP, the government has been slow to adapt to the ever changing world, especially when it comes to the internet. We will fix the mistakes of our predecessor and have it so almost if not all aspects of the government are able to be performed online. We are the innovation party, after all."
 JAP_honor_osaka: "Honor Osaka"
 JAP_honor_osaka_desc: "Osaka has become a very important city in modern Japan, and it's where our party has its origins. Out of honor for the city, we will make it our nation's vice-capital. "
 JAP_respect_the_imperial_family: "Respect the Imperial Family"
 JAP_respect_the_imperial_family_desc: "The imperial family has lost a lot of their influence since the death of Emperor Hirohito, and while we aren't putting them back in power, the least we can do is show them the respect they deserve. They've always been there for Japan, and we know the good example they've set will continue into the future."
 JAP_labor_code_reform: "Labor Code Reform"
 JAP_labor_code_reform_desc: "Labor laws in Japan have always found themselves leaning unfairly towards the employer. While it could always be worse, it could also certainly be better, and we will make it so."
 JAP_social_pact: "Social Pact"
 JAP_social_pact_desc: "We don't always have to agree with the people, in fact, no matter what we do there will certainly always be those who wish to butt heads with us. Regardless, when there is something that has potential to benefit us all, we can put our differences aside and come to a consensus."
 JAP_nationalizing_strategic_sectors: "Nationalize Strategic Sectors"
 JAP_nationalizing_strategic_sectors_desc: "There are some things in this world, and this nation, that when owned by certain people promote nothing but greed. This is when the state must step in, and assume controls of sectors it can use to benefit its civilians."
 JAP_progressive_business: "Progressive Business"
 JAP_progressive_business_desc: "While all business is good business, some is just better. Those who treat their workers with respect and dignity will always have a leg up on the soulless corporations forcing their employees to work hard for little to nothing. The former are the examples we want to set, and so they will be rewarded, so that others may be encouraged to follow their footsteps."
 JAP_fight_uyoku_dantai: "Fight Uyoku Dantai"
 JAP_fight_uyoku_dantai_desc: "Our changes to Japan have not gone uncontested, and we have been targeted by many on the right. While they are certainly doing what they believe is right, their actions have done nothing but harm people. As we cannot come to an agreement, it seems the halls of the diet will be tainted by conflict once more."
 JAP_humanizing_law_enforcement: "Humanizing Law Enforcement"
 JAP_humanizing_law_enforcement_desc: "While the police certainly make mistakes on occasion, so do we all. Authorities aren't always right, and the people can't expect them to be. No one is perfect. These are the messages we must get to the people, who see law enforcement in a negative light."
 JAP_new_refugee_policy: "New Refugee Policy"
 JAP_new_refugee_policy_desc: "We recognize that there are people around the world who are less fortunate than us. It's time to relax our migration policy in order to make Japan a more humane country."
 JAP_accept_challenges_time: "Accept the Challenges of Time"
 JAP_accept_challenges_time_desc: "No matter how the world changes around us, we must continue to adhere to the constitution. This extends to Article 9, perhaps its most controllable portion. Despite this, we don't need to mindlessly obey it, the need for a grander army is obvious. We will find a way to do this, without breaking the law of the land."
 JAP_privatization: "Privatization"
 JAP_privatization_desc: "Sharing is caring, so they say. That surely applies on a governmental level, so why have we been exempt for so long? There are people, experts in their field, who could manage certain assets we control so much better than us. As such, the transfer of these assets to the private sector is necessary. So they may be better managed, of course!"
 JAP_partnerships_entrepreneurs: "Partnership with Entrepreneurs"
 JAP_partnerships_entrepreneurs_desc: "Sometimes innovative business owners struggle to get their enterprises up and going. This robs many people of experiencing what that entrepreneur has to offer, and this is simply tragic. It is our duty as a nation to help these people succeed in their ordeals."
 JAP_budget_responsibility: "Budget Responsibility"
 JAP_budget_responsibility_desc: "While social spending can benefit some people, a stable economy helps more. One of the best ways to ensure that things stay in the black is a stable budget. While it doesn't exactly need to be balanced, as doing that would be extremely difficult, we can at least keep it from getting too volatile. And who knows, maybe somewhere down the line, a balanced budget is within the picture."
 JAP_civic_participation: "Civic Participation"
 JAP_civic_participation_desc: "While social spending can benefit some people, a stable economy helps more. One of the best ways to ensure that things stay in the black is a stable budget.

And who knows, maybe somewhere down the line, a balanced budget is within the picture."
 JAP_potential_threat: "Potential Threat"
 JAP_potential_threat_desc: "No one likes a communist, even communists are too busy fighting themselves to make change. After we defeated China in the Taiwan war, they surely began looking for more subtle ways to weaken us. One of these is, of course, planting communist agitators within our borders. While they have yet to make any moves, it's important we monitor their activity."
 JAP_follow_democratic_principles: "Follow Democratic Principles"
 JAP_follow_democratic_principles_desc: "Japan has been a democracy for close to 80 years at this point. While much of that time was spent under a single party, which seems undemocratic, elections were still free. As long as our nation exists in its current state, we will continue to follow these principles set forth by our wise ancestors."

 JAP_the_status_quo_remains_desc: "In a victory many saw coming, the Civil Coalition has been put in its place and our rule over Japan is certified. While for a moment party leadership was worried we might be defeated, it seems those fears were unwarranted. Now that the 2021 elections are over, we can get to work on pushing forwards our new agenda."
 JAP_new_era_for_japan: "New Era for Japan"
 JAP_new_era_for_japan_desc: "The Covid pandemic, while tragic, represents the end of an era. We became complacent with what we had, and it wasn't until crisis struck that we realized how in over our heads we were. No longer! We stand today on the eve of a new era, one where Japan will once again shine gloriously!"
 JAP_administrative_reforms: "Administrative Reforms"
 JAP_administrative_reforms_desc: "After the 2021 elections and our mismanagement of the Covid pandemic, it seems necessary that we sort out some kinks in the bureaucracy. The LDP is a gargantuan institution, and surely we can change a few things to make it more streamlined."
 JAP_together_with_you: "Together With You!"
 JAP_together_with_you_desc: "It is thanks to you, the Japanese people, that we are where we are today! Without your unwavering support, it would not have been possible for us to win the election. Together with you, we will continue forwards, bringing prosperity to all within our borders!"
 JAP_new_three_arrows: "The New Three Arrows"
 JAP_new_three_arrows_desc: "Shinzo Abe's three arrows were exactly what the doctor ordered for Japan, a decade ago. While they worked well in some fields, they also had their drawbacks. Now, with the inauguration of Taro Kono, the time has come for a reevaluation of these policies. We will keep what's beneficial, and remove what is not."
 JAP_green_energy_plan: "Green Energy Plan"
 JAP_green_energy_plan_desc: "Japan has never been well renowned for our production of fossil fuels, and for good reason. As the world grows increasingly polarized, and with the USA out of the picture, it is paramount we don't become reliant on anyone else. As such it's time to invest in other sources of energy, to make sure we're as self-sufficient as we can be."
 JAP_rural_benefits_programme: "Rural Benefits Programme"
 JAP_rural_benefits_programme_desc: "A major problem plaguing our nation is the flood of people moving from rural communities to the cities. As such, many people outside of urban areas feel they are being left behind. This will not do, as some of these people are among the most important to our economy, and so we will make sure they receive the benefits they need."
 JAP_stable_government_stable_market: "Stable Government, Stable Market"
 JAP_stable_government_stable_market_desc: "When a political situation seems volatile, investors tend to panic and pull out. This, of course, often leads to economic collapse. However, when the government exudes a sense of stability and tranquility, people are keen to get their peace of the pie. If the government is stable, the market is stable."
 JAP_kono_digitalization_programme: "Kono Digitalization Course"
 JAP_kono_digitalization_programme_desc: "The world we live in today is one of increasing interconnectivity. The main architect behind this is, of course, the internet. However, why should the internet be limited to just the civilians? As we continue to rocket towards the future, it's important the government is as online as the most chronic of gamers."
 JAP_new_japanese_capitalism: "A New Japanese Capitalism"
 JAP_new_japanese_capitalism_desc: "No one likes a snobby rich person, and equally many people don't enjoy the sight of a homeless person on the street. A strong capitalist system requires a strong middle class to make it work, but unfortunately, the Japanese middle class has been suffering. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has got just the fix for this predicament."
 JAP_provide_heavy_inflation_relief_packages: "Heavy Inflation Relief Packages"
 JAP_provide_heavy_inflation_relief_packages_desc: "Inflation, the greatest foe of any middle class family. Too many have been pushed into poverty because their wage doesn't match the market demand. We are a rich nation, and we can afford to send out some inflation relief packages. Happy people, happy economy."
 JAP_increase_minimum_wage: "Increase the Minimum Wage"
 JAP_increase_minimum_wage_desc: "Part-time jobs are, debatably, the most important part of capitalism. Millions of people around the globe work jobs part time, but too many here in Japan live off of them. The least we can do to help these part-time workers is raise the minimum wage, so that they can have an additional shield against inflation."
 JAP_subsidise_small_medium_businesses: "Ease Taxes for Small Businesses"
 JAP_subsidise_small_medium_businesses_desc: "The Covid Pandemic absolutely ruined small businesses worldwide, and here in Japan they are still recovering. However, in a number of cases, pre-pandemic taxes are proving to be too much for them to handle. We are living in a new age, an age where these taxes don't need to be so intoxicatingly high."
 JAP_startup_digitalization_economy: "Startup Digitalization of Economy"
 JAP_startup_digitalization_economy_desc: "The long, slow hours of the pandemic led to many bored people taking to their computers and coming up with projects to pass the time. However, some of these “projects” are rapidly developing into new industries, the biggest of which being AI. We must ensure that this new market is properly regulated, and that we get a slice of the digital pie just as big as everyone else's."
 JAP_form_pdto2: "Form the PDTO"
 JAP_form_pdto2_desc: "With the USA crippled across the Pacific, the Chinese Dragon has begun hungrily eying our allies in the South China Sea, Taiwan especially. We are eager to defend them, and we are not alone. Australia has also deemed China a significant threat, and so our three nations have agreed to form an alliance. The Pacific Defense Treaty Organization will be based off of NATO, but for the Pacific, and will have the goal of deterring Chinese aggression."
 JAP_first_pdto_military_exercises: "First PDTO Military Exercises"
 JAP_first_pdto_military_exercises_desc: "We have a very different military than Taiwan and Australia, and so it's paramount we make sure that they all work together. The first collaborative PDTO military exercises will be held soon, to encourage unity between our nations, but also to show China we aren't messing around."
 JAP_post_covid_stabilization2: "Post-COVID Stabilization"
 JAP_post_covid_stabilization2_desc: "As the heat finally quells from the Covid pandemic, we must use the time we have to bring the people together. The economy can wait for a bit, for it means nothing if our people are at each other's throats."
 JAP_invest_taiwanese_defences: "Invest Taiwanese Defences"
 JAP_invest_taiwanese_defences_desc: "Taiwan has been a point of contention in the Pacific for decades. With America no longer around to protect them, the Chinese seem closer to making their move than ever before. Taiwan is our ally, and we will do everything in our power to make sure they don't fall easily."
 JAP_ldp_unification_campaign: "LDP Unity Campaign"
 JAP_ldp_unification_campaign_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party is a big one, and it has many different factions. Those factions are occasionally subject to infighting, which can be healthy in some instances, but not right now. We should be exuding a sense of confidence and stability, so the world knows we are ready to take on our foes!"
 JAP_raise_defence_budget: "Raise the Defence Budget"
 JAP_raise_defence_budget_desc: "China has a defense budget that dwarfs Taiwan, Australia, and ours combined. This obviously isn't optimal for any kind of war against them, and while we don't have the funds to match their budget, we can certainly close the gap."
 JAP_start_information_war: "Start an Information War"
 JAP_start_information_war_desc: "A direct war against China would not go great for us without the USA, and as such we will have to find creative ways to deal with them. If we can blur the line between real and fake on the information they are receiving, we can potentially gain the upper hand in a conflict by blinding them."

 JAP_triumph_of_japanese_people: "Triumph of Japanese People"
 JAP_triumph_of_japanese_people_desc: "The idea that this century might be a Chinese one has finally been killed, for today we have shown the world how capable we are. We were able to defend Taiwan from the Chinese onslaught without the support of America, and democracy in East Asia lives to fight another day!"
 JAP_japan_new_course: "Japan New Course"
 JAP_japan_new_course_desc: "The dark years of the 90s and 2000s are far behind us, as we continue towards the future. Tokyo flourishes, Kyoto has never been in a better state, even Sapporo is benefiting. Perhaps best of all, the birth rate is going up. If we want to continue on this path, continued liberalization of Japan is a must."
 JAP_stimulate_gender_equality: "Stimulate Gender Equality"
 JAP_stimulate_gender_equality_desc: "Simply innovating Abe's womenomics isn't enough to stomp out gender inequality. While it might help in the workplace, at home, school, and in other fields it doesn't. It is our duty as the government to make sure everyone, man or woman, enjoys the same rights as everyone else."
 JAP_green_economy_future: "Green Economy of the Future"
 JAP_green_economy_future_desc: "As alternative energy continues to become more and more prominent, we must tie it into the economy. Japan is a beautiful country, and we will not allow it to be desecrated by industrialism like India and China. We will turn Japan into a green paradise, and keep a strong economy!"
 JAP_legal_flexibility: "Legal Flexibility"
 JAP_legal_flexibility_desc: "If we completely remove Article 9, we risk future generations of Japanese lawmakers falling back into our nation's dark history. Therefore, we will keep it, but work on deepening the loopholes nonetheless. We still need to defend ourselves, and our allies."
 JAP_economy_new_era: "Economy of the New Era"
 JAP_economy_new_era_desc: "The Japanese economy has seen a boom since the end of the Covid pandemic and the Taiwan war, as trust with the government is at an all time high. We would be fools not to use this to our advantage, and so we will get to work innovating the economy so that the boom doesn't go early."
 JAP_new_demographic_policy: "New Demographic Policy"
 JAP_new_demographic_policy_desc: "Shinzo Abe's womenomics policy was very effective, yet inequality in the workplace still remains. This must be addressed for our nation to continue on its path. If we innovate Abe's work to match modern standards, not only will our people benefit, but the economy as well."
 JAP_preserve_abe_legacy: "Preserve Abe's Legacy"
 JAP_preserve_abe_legacy_desc: "Shinzo Abe was a complicated man, but there is no denying his policies benefited our nation. If not for him, we would have been in no position to defend our ally from the red dragon. His Three Arrows will be continued, and his legacy will live on for years to come!"
 JAP_revival_showa_spirit: "Revival of the Showa Spirit"
 JAP_revival_showa_spirit_desc: "The latter half of the Showa Era, one of the best in our history, lasted nearly forty years, between the end of the Second World War and the beginning of the nineties. During that time, our culture changed drastically and our economy boomed. Now, we find ourselves entering what some are calling "The Second Showa Era," where Japanese prosperity has made its triumphant return!"
 JAP_harmony_labor_life: "Harmony of Labor and Life"
 JAP_harmony_labor_life_desc: "The work-life balance in our nation has been an unhealthy one for many years. However, with the new era of prosperity we find ourselves in, many are being paid more. As such they don't have to stress about work quite as much, and have been able to achieve a better harmony between the office and the home."
 JAP_national_consensus: "National Consensus"
 JAP_national_consensus_desc: "The constitution needs to be updated, especially Article 9, and the current government has decided it should be revised. However, it is up to the people to decide what they think should be changed, and so a national referendum will be held."
 JAP_our_victory: "Our Victory"
 JAP_our_victory_desc: "While the war against China was to defend the sovereignty of Taiwan, we were the victor. No one saw the conflict as one between China and Taiwan with Japanese backing, it was us versus them, and we triumphed. This is our victory, and we will treat it as such."
 JAP_support_for_veterans: "Support for Veterans"
 JAP_support_for_veterans_desc: "We shiver to think about what might have happened had we lost the war against China, luckily, we don't live in that reality. The people responsible for that are our veterans, who fought and killed for their homeland. We must repay them for everything they gave us!"
 JAP_moderate_approach: "Moderate Approach"
 JAP_moderate_approach_desc: "We have made it this far as a nation by not rocking the boat, and with a vibrant future ahead of us, it would do us good to not make any radical changes. If we continue on the course we're on, prosperity will find its way into the homes of all Japanese!"
 JAP_stable_leadership: "Stable Leadership"
 JAP_stable_leadership_desc: "A stable nation has an uncontroversial leader, and history has proven this time and time again. For a modern example, take a look at America. We will ensure our party leaders are popular in the eyes of the public, and won't do anything radical."
 JAP_balance_regional_development: "Balance of Regional Development"
 JAP_balance_regional_development_desc: "If some prefectures are rocketing into the future, and others are being left behind, nothing but discontent will arise. As such several bills are in the works to ensure everyone gets their fair share of our newfound prosperity."
 JAP_parliamentary_maneuvers: "Parliamentary Maneuvers"
 JAP_parliamentary_maneuvers_desc: "The constitution has many aspects that could get touched up a little, and it's the opinion of just about everyone to do so. In order to present a united Japan, we will work together with as many in parliament as we can to make sure the constitution gets the updates it needs."
 JAP_hardline_consolidation: "Hardline Consolidation"
 JAP_hardline_consolidation_desc: "The more radical groups of the LDP are small and don't have much power, and in the end, all they do is cause headaches for us. With so little influence, they don't really have a reason to exist. As such, they will be consolidated into the much larger factions of the party, for simplicity's sake."
 JAP_keep_it_stable: "Keep it Stable"
 JAP_keep_it_stable_desc: "The world goes around much more smoothly when everyone is happy, and stability achieves that. Instability breeds fear, which breeds hate, and on and on. As long as our nation is stable, it will prosper, and when our nation prospers, its people do so as well."
 JAP_establish_internal_dialogue: "Establish Internal Dialogue"
 JAP_establish_internal_dialogue_desc: "Miscommunication never did good for anyone, and we certainly will not tolerate it in our government. It is important that everyone feels that they speak on equal ground, and that they get their ideas out there. When we all work together, great things are possible!"
 JAP_party_modernization: "Party Modernization"
 JAP_party_modernization_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party still holds many aspects that have been called “ancient” by the people of today. We live in a world very different from the 1950s and 60s, and the LDP must realize that. Living in the past never did any good for anyone, especially not here in Japan."
 JAP_party_discipline: "Party Discipline"
 JAP_party_discipline_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party cannot afford to continue the trend of scandals that has plagued our modern history, discipline must be restored. The politicians must be reminded of where their loyalties lie. The party comes first, the people second, and their own interests dead last."
 JAP_ignite_nationalism: "Ignite Nationalism"
 JAP_ignite_nationalism_desc: "We saw during the Taiwan war the damage that a lack of proper respect for one's nation can do. Despite our victory in a just war, there were still many protests. We will preemptively quell the home front for any future wars by ensuring that they are proud of Japan."
 JAP_protection_party_heritage: "Protection of Party Heritage"
 JAP_protection_party_heritage_desc: "While, even we, must admit the LDP has struggled on occasion, we have still done a more than commendable job at leading Japan. We have led the nation through its prosperous ages, and we have shielded it from the worst of the dark ones. Our rivals will never again stand a chance at defeating us, for all we need to do is call upon the legends of the past, and our future is assured!"
 JAP_program_loyalty: "Program Loyalty"
 JAP_program_loyalty_desc: "We cannot have rogue politicians jeopardizing our agenda with their own plans. If a program has been established by a previous administration, the party must adhere to it, unless there is a significant reason for the contrary. "
 JAP_political_concretization: "Political Concretization"
 JAP_political_concretization_desc: "The volatile age of the 2021 election has quelled, and normalcy has returned to Japan.

 JAP_integration_komeito: "Integration of Komeito"
 JAP_integration_komeito_desc: "We have gotten to the point where the Komeito party is the LDP in everything but name. Managing our own little puppet has begun to put strain on the system, so leadership has decided that the time has come to absorb Komeito."
 JAP_law_order: "Law and Order"
 JAP_law_order_desc: "Maintaining a nation's law and order is something that seems increasingly challenging to do in today's world. We do not want to become like one of the many nations around the globe that hasn't fallen into civil conflict. Peace must be maintained, above all else."
 JAP_protect_rights_citizens: "Protect Rights of Citizens"
 JAP_protect_rights_citizens_desc: "As long as the administration stands, our people will remain free.

Our citizens must be able to freely express their anger, so that it does not find itself being pent up."
 JAP_coordination_opinions: "Coordination of Opinions"
 JAP_coordination_opinions_desc: "Agreeing on things is cool! While everyone has lived their own lives, and been molded by those experiences, that doesn't mean we all have to disagree. For the sake of the nation, we will ensure everyone in party shares similar opinions so the bureaucracy functions properly."
 JAP_collective_responsibility: "Collective Responsibility"
 JAP_collective_responsibility_desc: "The Liberal Democratic Party has a long and, frankly, unfortunate history of scandals. Whenever one of these came to light, everyone would immediately turn on the main perpetrator, even others involved. This will not do, and we must certify the idea that one person's mistake is all of our mistakes."
 JAP_open_new_ideas: "Open to New Ideas"
 JAP_open_new_ideas_desc: "We are reaching a point where the newer generations, mainly Gen Z, are finding their way into politics. The youth bring with them many new ideas, and while some are afraid they could shake up the party's stability, we are open to them. The world is always changing, and the LDP cannot remain static forever."
 JAP_party_rejuvination: "Cadres Rejuvenation"
 JAP_party_rejuvination_desc: "The elders of the LDP have done their nation a great service, but their time will be here soon enough. We cannot continue to rely on these politicians, those who will soon cross the threshold between life and death. We will shepherd them out, and continue to bring in the new minds of the youth."
 JAP_rebirth_establishment: "Rebirth of the Establishment"
 JAP_rebirth_establishment_desc: "The sun rises over Tokyo, the first Sakura trees begin to bloom, Mt. Fuji reflects off Lake Yamanaka. To the average person, life has not changed all that much. However, within the LDP, change has never been more present. The party has been given new ears, and new voices to listen too. The future beckons, and to achieve it we must forsake the past."

 JAP_leap_lost_taiwan: "Our defeat in Taiwan has given us an interesting opportunity, a chance to look inwards and reflect on our nation. Why should we be focusing so much time and money on defending our neighbors, when our people themselves are suffering? Prosperity might be a ways away, but China's victory hasn't stopped us from steadily marching forwards."
 JAP_leap_victory_taiwan: "Since we defeated China in the Taiwan war, our economy hasn't just boomed, it's exploded. We are racing towards the greatest prosperity our nation has ever seen faster than the Shinkansen. Now we must pour the massive funds we're receiving back into the country, so that we can turn our island home into a little slice of paradise."
 JAP_develop_northern_prefectures: "Develop Northern Prefectures"
 JAP_develop_northern_prefectures_desc: "Northern Japan always has, and probably always will be, the more rural part of the country. Past governments have spent most of their time on the central and southern prefectures, and so the north has missed out on its share of prosperity. Fortunately, there's now enough for everyone, and the north will finally be brought up to speed with the rest of the country."
 JAP_support_centre_prefectures: "Support Centre Prefectures"
 JAP_support_centre_prefectures_desc: "Undoubtedly the most important region of Japan, the central prefectures are also some of the most densely populated.

 JAP_revitalize_southern_prefectures: "Revitalize Southern Prefectures"
 JAP_revitalize_southern_prefectures_desc: "Before the focus of the government shifted to the center of the country, the south was the most important region. However, much of the southern infrastructure has been left behind to rot, and it is nowhere near the quality of the central prefectures. Now is the time to change that, for we live in a Japan with enough funds to bring prosperity back to the south."
 JAP_expand_urban_areas: "Expand Urban Areas"
 JAP_expand_urban_areas_desc: "Our efforts to slow the growth of urban areas as opposed to rural areas have worked, but only partially, and the population of the cities are still growing dramatically.

 JAP_age_of_reconstruction_desc: "Across the country infrastructure lies abandoned and neglected, remnants from the dark years of the 1990s and 2000s.

 JAP_new_leader_of_the_free_world_desc: "With our victory over China, and the USA incapacitated, we have proven we are capable of calling ourselves the leader of the pacific free world. From Canberra to Taipei, and all free cities in between, it's now our duty to protect them."
 JAP_reinforce_pdto: "Reinforce PDTO"
 JAP_reinforce_pdto_desc: "The war against China isn't easy, but it showed that the Pacific Defense Treaty Organization can be considered a legitimate entity. We went through a lot of work to get the alliance to where it is today, and we must remain vigilant. Who knows when China might try something again."
 JAP_own_economic_sphere: "Own Economic Sphere"
 JAP_own_economic_sphere_desc: "With China's defeat, many nations have fallen comfortably into our economic sphere. Our market now reaches as far as South America in some cases. With such a vast economic sphere, we must ensure it is managed correctly."
 JAP_new_allies: "New Allies"
 JAP_new_allies_desc: "Several nations expressed interest in the PDTO before the Taiwan war, and now that we've defeated China, some seem ready to become full members. The most notable is India, and New Zealand will be a valuable member."
 JAP_expanding_our_influence: "Expanding Our Influence"
 JAP_expanding_our_influence_desc: "The Taiwan war smashed China's level of foreign influence. We are now almost, if not more, influential than the Chinese in the Indo-Pacific. Still, we need to ensure the dragon stays down, and that we stay up. There are lots of places where we can expand our influence, and we will do so."
 JAP_made_in_japan: "Made in Japan"
 JAP_made_in_japan_desc: "Not many countries have a manufacturing capability that matches ours, and the few that do are often our rivals. In order to manage our sphere, we must ensure that the countries within it are buying the majority of their goods from us."
 JAP_recovery_assistance: "Recovery Assistance"
 JAP_recovery_assistance_desc: "China may have lost the war, but that doesn't mean they didn't deal plenty of strong punches. Taiwanese infrastructure across the island has been ruined as a result of Chinese aggression, and they need all the help they can get with rebuilding."
 JAP_continue_military_integration: "Continue Military Integration"
 JAP_continue_military_integration_desc: "Tokyo is nearly 8,000 kilometers from Sydney, and close to 6,000 from New Delhi. With such great distances between us and our allies, we must ensure that our militaries don't feel isolated from each other. They must be able to function together, as an effective fighting machine."
 JAP_stimulate_local_mic: "Stimulate Local MICs"
 JAP_stimulate_local_mic_desc: "While we are pro manufacturing our goods here, we can't let our allies fall behind on weapon production. All our enemy would need to do is intercept our convoys, and before we know it our allies can't supply their soldiers anymore. We will fund their own military industrial complexes."
 JAP_weapon_supplies: "Weapon Supplies"
 JAP_weapon_supplies_desc: "Japanese military equipment is some of the most advanced in the world, and our allies would greatly benefit from using it. Not to mention, a united fighting force should not be using all kinds of different weapons that are incompatible with each other. We will continue supplying our allies with our own equipment."
 JAP_scientific_collaboration: "Scientific Collaboration"
 JAP_scientific_collaboration_desc: "Asia is well known for producing bright minds, and if we put them all together, great things are possible. China wants to have a monopoly on innovation, but we won't let them. We will show them we're not only capable of beating them at war, but at the battle of the wits as well! "
 JAP_new_cooperation_agreement: "New Co-operation Agreement"
 JAP_new_cooperation_agreement_desc: "The Taiwanese have seen the need for a more comprehensive defense treaty with us, going beyond even the PDTO. We are always happy to defend our allies, and we will ensure the Taiwanese feel as safe as our own people."
 JAP_economic_pan_asianism: "Economic Pan-Asianism"
 JAP_economic_pan_asianism_desc: "The idea of Pan-Asianism is often attributed to the Japanese Empire, and their justification for waging war on the nations of this continent. However, if you take the idea at face value, and don't peek at its dark history, it's something that can be beneficial when applied to economics."
 JAP_our_european_partners: "Our European Partners"
 JAP_our_european_partners_desc: "Without the USA to buy our goods, we've had to investigate alternative markets. Our experts have deemed that, despite being far away, the European nations are a good place to double down on exports. "
 JAP_our_north_neighbour: "Our North Neighbour"
 JAP_our_north_neighbour_desc: "We have never gotten along well with Russia, but political rivalries should not get in the way of economic opportunities. We want them to buy our goods, and they want to do it too. Even if we will never be allies, surely a deal can be reached."
 JAP_promote_yen: "Promote Yen"
 JAP_promote_yen_desc: "With the effective collapse of the dollar, many countries are searching for an alternative currency. The Euro has been the most prominent one, but East Asia is obviously far away from Europe. As such, an opportunity has risen for us to persuade more countries to use the Yen."
 JAP_our_american_colleagues: "Our American Colleagues"
 JAP_our_american_colleagues_desc: "Our largest customer in the Americas was the USA up until recently, though for obvious reasons they're no longer a preferable candidate. Luckily, we're also well connected in the Latin America market, and our partners there would surely love to work together more frequently."
 JAP_development_programmes: "Development Programmes"
 JAP_development_programmes_desc: "Central and South America tends to lag behind much of the world when it comes to pretty much every field. If we want to benefit, our allies in the region must benefit, and no one else is helping them. It is our duty to fund development programs, the money will surely find its way back to us."
 JAP_seize_the_situation: "Seize the Situation"
 JAP_seize_the_situation_desc: "The Second American Civil War is a tragedy, but it is also an opportunity. We would be fools not to find a way to use the situation to benefit us, just about everyone else is. The different sides are eager to kill each other, and we have the tools they need to do it."

For the second time in a decade we are at war with the Chinese, only this time, the conflict has exploded to continental proportions. This is more than a war for Taiwan's sovereignty, it is a war for the continuation of free nations in East Asia."

 JAP_together_with_korea: "Together with Korea"
 JAP_together_with_korea_desc: "History repeats itself, first as a tragedy, second as a farce. The totalitarian regime of North Korea has thrown its lot in with China, and has gone after its southern counterpart once again. The South Koreans are one of our most valuable allies, for a number of reasons. Specifically, it is our easiest window to attack mainland China. Together we will push back the northern hordes, just as we did 7 decades ago!"
 JAP_secure_a_foothold_in_manchuria: "Secure a Foothold in Manchuria"
 JAP_secure_a_foothold_in_manchuria_desc: "With the North Koreans pushed back and their territory almost completely under friendly control, an invasion of Manchuria is only a river away. The Chinese will surely fight ruthlessly, but soon Japanese and Korean troops will cross the border, and the start of a new era in East Asia will begin."
 JAP_korean_question: "Korean Question"
 JAP_korean_question_desc: "With the Korean Peninsula united and free for the first time in over a century, a debate has arisen on our new foreign policy towards them. Some believe that we should tighten relations, place troops in their territory, and solidify our economic ties. Others argue doing this would be akin to what the Japanese Empire did to the peninsula, and that we should let the nation prosper on its own. The choice is up to us."
 JAP_our_southern_allies: "Our Southern Allies"
 JAP_our_southern_allies_desc: "The Chinese have earned their karma for years of agitation in South Asia.

 JAP_occupation_administrations: "Occupation Administrations"
 JAP_occupation_administrations_desc: "The territory we have snatched from China and its allies will not be effectively governed by the military, and if this continues discontent will run high.

 JAP_spiritual_mobilization_desc: "We Japanese have always been a proud people, one who respects our tradition and the generations who came before us.

 JAP_priority_to_military_corporations: "Priority to Military Corporations"
 JAP_priority_to_military_corporations_desc: "In these times of crisis we must acknowledge that certain sectors of the economy are doing more than others, most notably, the military corporations.

 JAP_redefine_the_japanese_army_desc: "A self defense force, that has been the proper term for our army since its formation. It was always meant to work in collaboration with the Americans, but without them, its weaknesses were shown. Change has already been made, but we must go one step further, and completely overhaul the JSDF."
 JAP_recall_the_battle_for_taiwan: "Recall the Battle of Taiwan"
 JAP_recall_the_battle_for_taiwan_desc: "Our encounters with the Chinese during the Taiwan war revealed many things to us. It was our first major conflict in decades, and we learned how our army handles on its own. We would be fools to ignore the mistakes and triumphs we had, the lessons we were taught will not go to waste."
 JAP_continue_rearmament: "Continue Rearmament"

 JAP_rikujo_jieitai: "Rikujō Jieitai"
 JAP_rikujo_jieitai_desc: "Initially ignored in favor of the navy and air force, our ground troops are becoming much more important. As both our and China's alliances grow, the chance we will encounter our foe with boots on the ground rises. We must now treat our soldiers with the same respect as our sailors and pilots."
 JAP_koku_jieitai: "Kōkū Jieitai"
 JAP_koku_jieitai_desc: "China's main window to attack our nation is the skylight, and we must ensure it's properly locked. Our air force saw numerous engagements with the Chinese during the Taiwan war, some victories, and some failures. We must reinforce it properly, so that the skies stay clear of hostiles."
 JAP_kaijo_jieitai: "Kaijō Jieitai"
 JAP_kaijo_jieitai_desc: "No matter what happens in this world, we will always be an island nation. As such we will always require a strong navy, one capable of protecting the home isles and protecting power abroad. We will inevitably face the Chinese at sea numerous times, just as we did while defending Taiwan, and we will be ready."

 JAP_mass_production_of_the_rising_suns_airplanes_desc: "The Mitsubishi X-2 is one of the greatest achievements of modern Japanese aerospace engineering. While not as advanced as its American counterparts, it is still our first domestically produced stealth fighter. While development continues on the F-X, we must bolster our X-2 fleet."
 JAP_return_to_the_super_kai_program: "Return to the "Super Kai" Program"
 JAP_return_to_the_super_kai_program_desc: "While the Mitsubishi F-2 is beginning to show its age, it is still a reliable fighter that is easy to produce. During this time of peace, we will push our engineers around the clock to work on advancing the plane so that it can easily go toe-to-toe with its Chinese rivals."
 JAP_experimental_uavs: "Experimental UAVs"
 JAP_experimental_uavs_desc: "Unmanned aerial vehicles have found themselves at the core of modern warfare, and we are late to the show. However, we are more than capable of coming up with advanced designs for combat drones as a strong western nation. The time has come to catch up with the rest of the world."
 JAP_increase_dockyard_construction_plan: "Increase Dockyard Construction Plan"
 JAP_increase_dockyard_construction_plan_desc: "Our fleet was damaged in the Taiwan war, and while not being eradicated, it could use some bolstering. Up to now, we've been pretty relaxed when it comes to dockyard construction quotas. Unfortunately we can no longer afford this luxury, and must ensure our workers are churning out new ships as fast as they can."
 JAP_expand_the_carrier_fleet: "Expand the Carrier Fleet"
 JAP_expand_the_carrier_fleet_desc: "Even today, planes are not capable of flying indefinitely without refueling. Even if they can reach farther, our fighters will not be able to protect our allies to the far south. The response? Build more carriers to protect the skies of those places we cannot reach."
 JAP_anti_ship_missile_development: "Anti-ship Missile Development"
 JAP_anti_ship_missile_development_desc: "Long gone are the days of pirate ships sailing alongside each other, trading cannon shots.

 JAP_investments_in_infantry_and_artillery_development: "Investments in Infantry and Artillery Development"
 JAP_investments_in_infantry_and_artillery_development_desc: "We learned from World War 2 that the Japanese army is not one that should rely heavily on tanks. While it still helps to have a decently sized arsenal of the beasts on treads, our ground forces today rely heavily on infantry and artillery. We must reshape this aspect of our armed forces to better combat Chinese doctrine."
 JAP_armored_unmanned_vehicles: "Armored Unmanned Vehicles"
 JAP_armored_unmanned_vehicles_desc: "Why should the air force get all the love when it comes to unmanned vehicles? Unlike the Chinese, when we see a chance to remove some human suffering from the equation, we take it.

 JAP_wide_application_of_exoskeletons: "Wide Application of Exoskeletons"
 JAP_wide_application_of_exoskeletons_desc: "When someone imagines an exoskeleton, they either think of bugs or big bulky sci-fi machinery.

 JAP_a_worthy_successor_to_the_imperial_army: "A Worthy Successor to the Imperial Army"
 JAP_a_worthy_successor_to_the_imperial_army_desc: "The Imperial Army may have fought for different reasons than we do today, but they were still an efficient fighting force.

Yet their tragedy became our moment of realization, and now we are capable of defending the free nations of Asia!"
 JAP_conscription_reform: "Conscription Reform"
 JAP_conscription_reform_desc: "Our army is made up entirely of volunteers, something we are proud of. So many are willing to defend their nation of their own free will.

Conscription will not be mandatory, but it will be encouraged and enlistees will be compensated handsomely."
 JAP_rikujo_kaijo_koku_coordination: "Rikujō-Kaijō-Kōkū Coordination"
 JAP_rikujo_kaijo_koku_coordination_desc: "Factionalism is bad everywhere, especially in the armed forces.

 JAP_ignite_japanese_patriotism: "Ignite Japanese Patriotism"
 JAP_ignite_japanese_patriotism_desc: "The saying, as it goes, says “patriotism is loving your country for what it does, nationalism is loving your country no matter what it does.” The latter is harmful to many people, both in the nation and beyond it.

 JAP_defeat_declare_martial_law: "Declare Martial Law"

 JAP_defeat_economic_inventory_desc: "We lost many assets during the Taiwan war, not to mention the goods China no longer manufactures for us. If we want to get the economy back in the black, we need to take stock of what we can use, and how we can use it."
 JAP_defeat_public_private_partnership: "Public-Private Partnership"
 JAP_defeat_public_private_partnership_desc: "We do not have to be rivals with the corporations, and it is more than possible for us to collaborate on all sorts of topics. They are Japanese too, and together we will make our nation glorious!"
 JAP_defeat_national_security_council: "National Security Council"
 JAP_defeat_national_security_council_desc: "Since we are no longer in a position to protect other nations, we must ensure all our focus is turned towards protecting our people. There are people who are skilled when it comes to security at home, and they will be placed on a new council, so that no Japanese citizen must ever live in fear." 
 JAP_defeat_glorify_traditional_values: "Glorify Traditional Values"
 JAP_defeat_glorify_traditional_values_desc: "We in Japan have always stood for honor, not giving up, and doing your best. These values are noble today, and they always will be. We must make sure no one ever forgets these ideals, and so they must be ingrained in public consciousness for generations to come. "
 JAP_defeat_unite_free_asia: "Unite Free Asia"
 JAP_defeat_unite_free_asia_desc: "Our loss in Taiwan has shown the nations of free Asia the full extent of the Chinese threat. As such, the PDTO has received several new applications from nations that fear the dragon and want to know that they'll be protected. Most notably among these is India, and New Zealand will also be valuable members."
 JAP_defeat_ardent_panasianism: "Ardent Pan-asianism"
 JAP_defeat_ardent_panasianism_desc: "If we want to have any chance of defeating China, we must stand together! From New Delhi to Seoul, the Asian world must unite under effective leadership and stand up to the Chinese aggressors!"
 JAP_defeat_utilize_anticommunism: "Utilize Anticommunism"
 JAP_defeat_utilize_anticommunism_desc: "Plenty of people across the continent are less than enthusiastic about the idea of living in a communist society, and we can easily weaponize that. The American Red Scare effectively wiped out all communists within the country for decades, and if we can recreate our own controlled version, we can greatly weaken Chinese influence."
 JAP_defeat_united_armed_forces: "United Armed Forces"
 JAP_defeat_united_armed_forces_desc: "One of the reasons for our defeat in Taiwan was our army's inability to work with our allies. We had a very different doctrine from the Taiwanese, who in turn had a very different doctrine from the Australians. Now that we have even more allies, we must unite our armed forces under a centralized command in order to stand any chance against the Chinese."
 JAP_defeat_long_japanese_hand: "Long Japanese Hand"
 JAP_defeat_long_japanese_hand_desc: "There are still nations in the Indo-Pacific region that have yet to choose a side, and so the clash of influence between us and China has begun. We will bring them into our fold, for the Chinese can not be allowed to find any more allies!"
 JAP_defeat_fund_taiwanese_resistance: "Fund Taiwanese Resistance"
 JAP_defeat_fund_taiwanese_resistance_desc: "The fighting spirit of the Taiwanese knows no bounds, and the Chinese occupiers find themselves preoccupied with a large partisan movement. We need to keep those partisans active, the more distractions the dragon has, the better."
 JAP_defeat_collective_sovereignity: "Collective Sovereignty"
 JAP_defeat_collective_sovereignity_desc: "Asia will never be ruled by one master, no matter how much China wishes it could be. While we may be the leader of the PDTO, we stand as equals among all other nations on the continent. For now, and forever, Asia will be free!"
 JAP_defeat_own_economic_sphere: "Own Economic Sphere"
 JAP_defeat_own_economic_sphere_desc: "As China is no longer an option when it comes to economic partnership, we must fall back on the more reliable members of our economic sphere. We still have lots of influence on the global economy, and if we play our cards right, we can garner even more."
 JAP_defeat_forced_cooperation: "Forced Cooperation"
 JAP_defeat_forced_cooperation_desc: "The Australians are our first, and most valued ally in the Pacific. Our economies are more linked than ever, and trade between us is booming. We are very enthusiastic to work with them on all kinds of projects, even if they are not. "
 JAP_defeat_east_economic_autarky: "East Economic Autarky"
 JAP_defeat_east_economic_autarky_desc: "The East has been propped up by countries around the globe for far too long. We live in an era where, whether we like it or not, it tends to be every man for himself. We cannot allow our economy to rely on anyone else, lest we suffer for their mistakes."
 JAP_defeat_unifying_our_economies: "Unifying Our Economies"
 JAP_defeat_unifying_our_economies_desc: "No matter how much we wish it was possible, we will never be able to become fully self-sufficient. However, we have enough allies with enough unique markets, that with a lot of planning and a bit of luck, we could arrange it so we only rely on each other. "
 JAP_defeat_forget_about_america: "Forget About America"
 JAP_defeat_forget_about_america_desc: "While this is a painful truth to realize, the USA no longer exists. It has torn itself to shreds over a so-called “culture war.” As such, who are we supposed to pay our debts too? For the duration of the Second American Civil War, and potentially forever, we will cease all debt payments to the USA."
 JAP_defeat_international_community_assistance: "International Community Assistance"
 JAP_defeat_international_community_assistance_desc: "Believe it or not, there are plenty of nations around the globe who don't want to see a Chinese dominated Asia. We are their best bet to stop that from happening, and so with a few small sacrifices and some good negotiating, we'll be able to procure strong international support."
 JAP_defeat_attract_labor_migrants: "Attract Labor Migrants"
 JAP_defeat_attract_labor_migrants_desc: "Japan wants you! Looking for a better life overseas, one away from home? Want to explore the vibrant culture of a rich nation, and experience everything it has to offer? No matter what your profession is, there is surely a job opportunity for you here in the Land of the Rising Sun!"
 JAP_defeat_consolidation_of_unstable_coalition: "Consolidation Of Unstable Coalition"
 JAP_defeat_consolidation_of_unstable_coalition_desc: "Many of our coalition members are unbridled and rebellious. However now that we are rebuilding our image, consolidation is on the table, and we will bring these stray parties home."
 JAP_defeat_harmonization_of_laws: "Harmonization Of Laws"
 JAP_defeat_harmonization_of_laws_desc: "The parties within our coalition vary from left to right, and occasionally bicker amongst themselves. If we are to appear as a strong, united government, we must force these parties to play nice with each other, whether they want to or not." 
 JAP_defeat_interparty_vertical: "Interparty Vertical"
 JAP_defeat_interparty_vertical_desc: "Anyone who thinks that all members of a coalition stand on equal ground is a fool. In the end, the parties we're allied to are only for more votes. With the recent reconciliations and changes to our coalition, it's time to reestablish the hierarchy."
 JAP_defeat_reconstruction_of_civil_society: "Reconstruction Of Civil Society"
 JAP_defeat_reconstruction_of_civil_society_desc: "We are all Japanese, and we all want to see what is best for our nation. While we don't intend to rebuild society from the ground up, we can certainly work out a few kinks so that we can collaborate better with the opposition, and politics can function smoother."
 JAP_defeat_media_monopoly: "Media Monopoly"
 JAP_defeat_media_monopoly_desc: "The media continues to be a thorn in our side, going after every scandal their grubby hands can get evidence on. If we want to encourage stability in Japan, we must ensure the media works in our favor. "
 JAP_defeat_judicial_reform: "Judicial Reform" 
 JAP_defeat_judicial_reform_desc: "The judicial branch of the government has operated fairly independently for much of its history. For a long time, that worked out fine. However with Chinese saboteurs and other foreign threats, it's paramount we bring the justice department under our direct supervision."
 JAP_defeat_constitutional_referendum: "Constitutional Referendum"
 JAP_defeat_constitutional_referendum_desc: "Our constitution has only gone through one small change in its 80 year history. Lots more has changed in that time span, and so the constitution must change with it. The most important change, of course, would be the removal of Article 9."
 JAP_defeat_destroy_the_radicals: "Destroy The Radicals"
 JAP_defeat_destroy_the_radicals_desc: "“Clowns to the left of me, and jokers to the right” is a saying that perfectly embodies our current politics. On one side of the spectrum, you have the communists who will stop at nothing to make us a slave to China. On the other side, you have the nationalists who's wet dream is the restoration of the empire. Neither of these ideals will ever be allowed anywhere near the seat of the prime minister."
 JAP_defeat_resist_foreign_influence: "Resist Foreign Influence"
 JAP_defeat_resist_foreign_influence_desc: "China, Russia, even North Korea, all these nations and more would like nothing else than to control us. While we may find ourselves more isolated than we have in decades as a result of our defeat in the Taiwan war, we refuse to give in to pressure. Japan stands tall, like it always has!"
 JAP_defeat_uncontested_civil_administration: "Uncontested Civil Administration"
 JAP_defeat_uncontested_civil_administration_desc: "If we give in to the pressure of the JSDF, we risk losing our democracy. The Second World War is a great example of what happens when the military has too much power. We will make sure they stick to what they're good at, defending the nation, not running it."
 JAP_defeat_strengthen_JSDF_positions: "Strengthen JSDF Positions"
 JAP_defeat_strengthen_JSDF_positions_desc: "Security is a must have in the world of today, and who's good at security? Why, the military of course. While we won't be handing the government over to them, we will strengthen the influence the JSDF has on it, so that we never have to worry about our people's safety again."
 JAP_defeat_russian_reconciliation: "Russian Reconciliation"
 JAP_defeat_russian_reconciliation_desc: "Russia has never been close to us, but between them and China, the answer is obvious. They too have had a shaky history with China, friends at one moment, enemies at the next. We are much more reliant than the Chinese, and surely with enough time, we can come to a deal with our northern neighbors."

 jap.1.t: "First Covid Case Confirmed"
 jap.1.d: "Japan has confirmed its first case of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus from China, the health ministry said Thursday.\n\nA Chinese national in his 30s who lives in Kanagawa Prefecture tested positive for the virus, the ministry said. He returned from Wuhan on Jan. 6 and was hospitalized on Jan. 10, but has already recovered and was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday."
 jap.1.a: "Oh No..."
 jap.2.t: "2020 Olympics Delayed"
 jap.2.d: "As the number of people infected by Covid-19 increase with the day, the international olympic committee together with the Japanese government have discussed what would be the most appropriate action, with the risk of the olympics being an hotbed for disease which could put athletes and tourists as well as Japanese citizens at risk of infection, both parties have announced to delay the Olympics until the rate of infections have reached an all time low.\n\nGlobal disappointment has occurred upon this news as the Japanese government has promised to go great lengths to ensure that Covid will no longer be a threat anymore."
 jap.2.a: "The torch will be passed on."
 jap.3.t: "The Games of the XXXII Olympiad Begin"
 jap.3.d: "The Covid pandemic has been widespread and as the numbers of infected rise, there has also been the rising issue on whether it is wise to let the Olympics happen or not.\n\nThe Japanese government and the international olympic committee have had a long discussion about this and have decided not to delay the Olympics. Despite rising criticism against this decision from several health experts and other nations, both the committee and Japan have ensured they will ensure that health will remain top priority.\n\nWith this decision the Olympics are ready to begin as athletes from all over the world are ready to compete against each other, with health measures taken to a logical extreme,time will only tell if this won't cause a major outbreak."
 jap.3.a: "Nothing to worry about, enjoy the games."
 jap.4.t: "The Question of the Olympics"
 jap.4.d: "Everyone can sense that the long peace will not last forever, our American friends are having their own internal struggles which can escalate at any moment and China is looking at its claims with hungry eyes.\n\nWith tensions increasing globally, a new question arises as the responsibility of hosting the olympics is put onto us. We can of course, simply host it and hope to foster the spirit of sportsmanship among the people of the world, but the risk of it being more fuel to the fire persists. Not to mention Covid-19, a virus that has stunted us for quite a while, separating families and making us isolate ourselves, with so many people in one city, a superspreader event is possible.\n\nWe can also call it off, seeing the security and health risk, it might be best to not give more incentive to our rivals for political aggression.\n\nIn the end, the decision was made:"
 jap.4.a: "Regardless of the risks, they will be hosted"
 jap.4.b: "Quench the fire, call off the Olympics"
 jap.5.t: "The Formation of the PDTO"
 jap.5.d: "The Pacific Defense Treaty Organization, or PDTO is formed as tensions with a irredentist China is rising. It is formed by two founding nations, namely the Commonwealth of Australia and the State of Japan."
 jap.5.a: "We must defend Taiwan!"
 jap.6.t: "Twilight's Last Gleaming"
 jap.6.d: "The unthinkable has occurred, one of our greatest allies has descended into a state of internal strive, neighbor against neighbor, parent against child, an entire continent delved into violence.\n\nWith every chaotic event, the vultures start to circle above and we're aware with the loss of our good American friends, that the Chinese are now looking at Taiwan with hungry eyes, seeing the civil war as a prime chance to finalize their long standing conflict.\n\nAsia will inevitably face war as well, despite our difficulties, we cannot abandon Taiwan.\n\nWe are not alone, with our remaining allies, we will face the dragon."
 jap.6.a: "Expect the worst"
 jap.7.t: "The Land of Rising Sun"
 jap.7.d: "Ever since the end of world war two, Japan has gone through turbulent times, but with its allies across the globe and willingness to adapt, Japan has managed to not only survive but also thrive.\n\nThe 2020's haven't been too kind on us, an aging population and a military held on a leash are just a few of the problems that remain to be a thorn in our eyes.\n\nWith Shinzo Abe's resignation in sight,  dark clouds gathering above the rest of Asia and the rising tensions amongst our western allies, time only can tell what these new turbulent times may bring. A clear mind and a strong spirit is needed to ensure that we won't be cast into the shadows."
 jap.7.a: "We have much work to do."
 jap.8.t: "The Taiwan War"
 jap.8.d: "The U.S. Civil War has undoubtedly reshuffled the geopolitical landscape of East Asia, and for Japan, the most immediate and pressing challenge is the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. As a crucial node in the first island chain, Taiwan holds immense strategic importance. If it falls, not only will the defense system of the first island chain be severed, but Japan's homeland will be directly exposed to China's military threat, leading to a collapse of the balance of power in the entire Asia-Pacific region.\n\nFor the Japanese government, the fall of Taiwan would not only be a significant loss for the democratic camp but would also place Japan in a strategically passive position. Should China control Taiwan, it would gain a vital strategic foothold, allowing its naval forces to project deeper into the Pacific, directly threatening Japan's maritime lifeline. \n\nTherefore, Japan's only option is to intervene in the Taiwan conflict and assist Taiwan in resisting China's invasion."
 jap.8.a: "We will win!"
 jap.9.t: "Victory!"
 jap.9.d: "Through weeks of harsh battle and with the loss of many, China has pulled back from Taiwan.\n\nWith our combined efforts, we have successfully safeguarded the island from Chinese aggression, humiliating their years of propaganda and threats.\n\nAs they limp back to their homes, we'll be rebuilding and express gratitude to our allies for their much needed help. As we mourn the ones we lost, and bask in the glory of victory, the realization that this might not be the last we'll see of Chinese aggression is starting to dawn on us.\n\nThey'll be back, but now we'll be ready."
 jap.9.a: "Gureto!"
 jap.10.t: "Shameful Defeat"
 jap.10.d: "The dragon's fire was too much for us. After months of harsh warfare, the red banner of the people's republic flies above Taipei, a scenario none of us wished to imagine.\n\nWith our wounds festering and our allies distraught, our people at home are furious at the lives wasted, the widows are weeping and the orphans will never go home. Such humiliation will be a heavy weight on our collective souls, a weight that might shatter the fabric of civility in our nation.\n\nAlready there are groups expressing their anger and frustration at the government, [JAP_ldp_reelection_loc]\n\nWith this defeat, Japan will never be the same."
 jap.10.a: "Owari Da!"
 jap.11.t: "Ukraine Recognizes South Kuril Islands as Japanese"
 jap.11.d: "The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a resolution on the recognition of the southern Kuril Islands as "the territory of Japan occupied by Russia," according to the data on the parliament's website.\n\n"The Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine declares its support for Japan's position regarding its Northern Territories; recognizes that these territories continue to be under the occupation of the Russian Federation," the text of the document says. In the same text, Kyiv called on the international community to take all possible measures "to legally formalize the status of the Northern Territories of Japan.""
 jap.11.a: "Huh?"
 jap.12.t: "The Game Awards Intruder"
 jap.12.d: "The Game Awards even with unplanned relocation and rescheduling of the conference still surprised with many announcements, trailers and awards. However, the most unexpected and crazy moment happened at the very end of the exhibition: right after the presentation of the "Game of the Year" Elden Ring, the Taiwanese people were nominated from the stage.\n\n"Hey, Motto. For real people, I want to say that for this award I want to nominate this award to my guys from Taiwan, keep Taiwan free!" this speech sounded from the stage immediately after the words of the developers of the Elden Ring.\n\nAccording to the chief executive and organizer of the show, Geoff Keighley, the guy was detained for further proceedings. Apparently, he has not been charged with anything."
 jap.12.a: "Keep the Spirit Strong!"
 jap.13.t: "Shinzo Abe resigns"
 jap.13.d: "Shinzo Abe said on Friday he was stepping down from the post because of his deteriorating health. Talks about his health escalated when he visited a Tokyo hospital for the second time in a week on Monday. Abe has long suffered from ulcerative colitis.\n\nIt will take two to three weeks to choose a new party leader. The winner must be formally elected by a parliamentary vote and will serve as prime minister for the remainder of Abe's term, i.e. until September 2021."
 jap.13.a: "Rest, patriot..."
 jap.14.t: "Yoshihide Suga elected Prime Minister"
 jap.14.d: "Yoshihide Suga, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, has been elected as the country's new head of government. His candidacy was supported by a majority of MPs in the House of Representatives. A total of 314 MPs out of 465 voted in favour of the new prime minister."
 jap.14.a: "Is he a worthy heir?"
 jap.15.t: "LDP leadership election"
 jap.15.d: "The internal LDP elections are in full swing, party members shake hands with one another and make soothing promises, calling in favors and expanding their own circles, yet in this political arena only two have become a towering presence.\n\nFirst up is Fumio Kishida, a well known centrist that maintains some stability in the internal LDP politics, appealing to party members on both sides of the spectrum and having the idea of the now named "New form of capitalism" which aims to ease the burdens on the middle class, making life more fair to them and in turn incentivizes them to contribute to the economy.\n\nThe other one, Taro Kono, is considered a liberal within and outside the LDP, he aims to reevaluate Shinzo Abe's three arrows and perform a greenification of Japan, wishing to reduce the amount of nuclear power plants in favor of renewable energy, loved by the people but the disdain a good chunk of LDP members have for him is hard to ignore.\n\nNonetheless, the votes are counted, with open ears the party listens to the results."
 jap.15.a: "Fumio Kishida"
 jap.15.b: "Taro Kono"
 jap.16.t: "General Election are coming!"
 jap.16.d: "After weeks of campaigning, insults and small scandals, the elections are about to hit its peak, with both the opposition and LDP giving it their all to sway as many voters to their side as possible.\n\nAlthough it is predicted that the voter turnout will be low, there are still enough people that go out there to vote for their preferred party. The LDP has experience, promises of stability and certainty while the opposition ensures there'll be a proper change, progress and renewal, with the heated debates reaching their ends and the votes being cast, it's ultimately up to the people to decide who'd stand victorious."
 jap.16.a: "It's time for a change!"
 jap.16.b: "Keep it stable!"
 jap.17.t: "LDP won!"
 jap.17.d: "To the surprise of absolutely no one, the political dominance of the LDP is kept in place as the counted votes have declared the LDP the winner.\n\nThe response to the results are mixed, some are disappointed while others are happy that Japan is on a steady course of certainty and stability, already the civil coalition has expressed a dedication to expand and campaign for the next elections."
 jap.17.a: "Same as it ever was"
 jap.18.t: "Civil Coalition won!"
 jap.18.d: "To the surprise of absolutely everyone, the political dominance of the LDP has been halted, the coalition which consists of all kinds of opposition members have given it their all during the campaign and those efforts have paid off.\n\nAlthough there are mixed responses to this, there is also a lot of optimism for the future, stagnation has ended and with that the new can come in."
 jap.18.a: "Let's hope they stick together"
 jap.19.t: "Civil Coalition formed"
 jap.19.d: "It was inevitable that the LDP would get a sizable opponent to deal with in the great arena of politics, the civil coalition is a collection of opposition members that have banded together to put a stop to the iron grip the LDP has over the political landscape of Japan.\n\nAlthough very young and somewhat unconventional in its methods, the civil coalition has managed to garner enough support to become a credible threat to the LDP, with the elections rearing its head soon, this might become a game changer."
 jap.19.a: "Amateurs."
 jap.20.t: "Kinmen Freed"
 jap.20.d: "This morning, we received frontline reports confirming that after a fierce offensive by our forces, we have finally retaken Kinmen Island. Although the PLA garrison inflicted significant damage on us using their defensive fortifications, they were ultimately overwhelmed by our superior numbers. The island's primary military installations and command centers are now under the control of the Self-Defense Forces.\n\nWith Kinmen Island, a key strategic position, now firmly in our grasp, Chinese cities and supply lines are within the range of our artillery. We are now able to exert pressure on the PLA's supply routes, creating an advantage for our forces on the front lines."
 jap.20.a: "Banzai!"
 jap.21.t: "Kinmen Operation Fails"

Additionally, our reinforcements and supply lines were cut off by PLA strikes, preventing further support.

The left-wing parties in Japan has a broad grassroots base and strong organizational and mobilization capabilities. Despite ideological differences between the CDP and the left-wing parties, they share common ground on certain policy issues, such as social welfare and environmental protection, providing an opportunity for cooperation.\n\nFollowing a series of negotiations and discussions, the CDP and the Communist Party, Reiwa Shinsengumi and SDP reached a consensus and decided to establish a political alliance. This decision immediately sparked a public outcry. Supporters viewed it as progress for Japan's democratic politics, while opposition voices were equally strong. Some feared that the influence of left-wing parties would gradually grow and ultimately pose a threat to Japan's democratic system. Others questioned whether two parties with such significant ideological differences could truly cooperate or if the alliance would turn into a case of "strange bedfellows."\n\n"This is like a political marriage," said an anonymous political analyst. "Both sides have come together with their own objectives, and whether they can sustain the alliance in the long run remains to be seen.""

They needed to form alliances with other opposition parties to gain an advantage in the political arena.Currently, the CDP is actively collaborating with the Innovation Party, which represents reformists and centrist policies, as well as the Democratic Party for the People.\n\nIn a press conference, the leader of the CDP stated that the cooperation with the Innovation Party and the DPP is based on shared political ideals and goals. He emphasized that all three parties are committed to promoting political reform in Japan, improving the well-being of citizens, and upholding social justice and fairness. He also noted that this partnership is not a mere political alliance, but a means to better respond to the public's expectations and create a brighter future for Japan.\n\nHowever, this "straddling both sides" strategy has sparked considerable skepticism and controversy. Some commentators argue that there are ideological differences between the CDP, the Innovation Party, and DPP, particularly on issues like constitutional reform and fiscal policy. Whether this "patchwork" cooperation can truly achieve policy coordination and unity remains to be seen."

 jap.56.d: "Since we initiated efforts for unification across the Taiwan Strait, the number of security incidents within our nation's interior has surged dramatically. This increase can partly be attributed to wartime tensions and the backlash against strict control measures. However, agents from the Ministry of State Security have uncovered a surprising number of cases involving suspected espionage. After thorough investigation and analysis, we have confirmed that these activities are orchestrated by our "old friends" from Japan's Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office and the Defense Intelligence Headquarters.\n\nThe Japanese intelligence agencies understand that they cannot rely solely on military strength to confront us on the battlefield. Instead, they have resorted to strategies aimed at destabilizing our social order to weaken public support for the war. Numerous incidents attest to the boldness of their covert operations. For instance, workers at a drone component factory in Shenzhen recently staged a massive strike, which required the city government months of negotiations and personnel adjustments to resolve. Additionally, front-line photos and purported "PLA combat loss" videos—both real and fabricated—have been widely circulated on social media platforms such as WeChat, Weibo, QQ, and Bilibili. Dealing with these individuals is not particularly challenging. However, the real issue lies in the sheer volume of hostile activities, the rapid pace at which they occur, and the elusive nature of their masterminds."

The assassin appears to be part of the fringe right that persists in the darker corners of Japanese society; several books dedicated to revolution and a warrior lifestyle were found in his apartment.\n\nThis has set a dangerous precedent where politicians can get attacked at random by extremists, the civil coalition has obviously denounced this attack and internally has discussed whether it is a good idea to call snap elections in order to maintain credibility.\n\nThere is enough pushback to this however, the concern that snap elections would divide the civil coalition, in any case, a decision has to be made."

They guard the outlet of the Sea of Okhotsk, control vital maritime routes, and possess rich fishing resources along with potential oil and natural gas reserves. Over the past decades, Japan and Russia have experienced a series of protests, compromises, and conflicts over the sovereignty of these islands.\n\nHowever, Japan's government is now focused on countering China's growing influence, and many within the government believe that Japan is neither capable nor in a position to antagonize Russia further. Resolving the Kuril Islands issue could alleviate Japan's northern defense pressures and pave the way for a series of trade agreements with Russia to boost economic development. Still, some argue that Japan should not abandon its claims to these inherent territories."

A large crowd has gathered in front of the Prime Minister's Office. Supporters believe that giving up the territorial dispute is a necessary trade-off for long-term peace and stability. Opponents, however, condemn the government's weakness, viewing it as a betrayal of national dignity and pride, and an abandonment of historical grievances."

 jap.83.d: "A wave of economic revival has swept across Russia's Far East. Massive Japanese investments have flowed in like a tide, covering everything from energy development to infrastructure projects. Fish processing plants have adopted Japan's advanced technologies and equipment, and the timber trade has seen rapid growth, with Russia's vast forest resources being exported worldwide through Japanese channels.\n\nJapanese goods now fill the shelves of shopping centers across Russia, offering everything from high-tech electronics to everyday essentials, meeting virtually all local consumer needs. Once dilapidated factories in the Far East have been revitalized with Japanese funding and technology, driving a boom in the local job market. Modern production lines operate non-stop, absorbing a large workforce and boosting economic growth, greatly improving the living standards of the region's residents."

 jap.84.d: "Since our increased cooperation, Russian energy companies have established strategic partnerships with energy companies within our country. Together, they have cooperated in constructing multiple oil pipelines and liquefied natural gas receiving terminals, ensuring the stability and security of our energy supply. Additionally, Russia has undertaken the construction of several large domestic projects, including high-speed railways, ports, and bridges. In particular, Russian investment has significantly improved transportation conditions in the Hokkaido region, boosting tourism and related industries.\n\nIn addition to economic cooperation, Japan and Russia have made significant progress in cultural exchanges. Russian rock and punk music have gained considerable popularity in the Japanese market. Moreover, the two countries have achieved multiple successes in film exchanges. So much so that soyuzmultfilm began cooperation with several anime studios to create a joint Russian-Japanese cartoon, in the process exchanging experience in creating cartoons, other than that the influx of russian movies and series flooded Japan for the series "the king and the Fool" (dubbed in japanese as Koror i Shut) became popular in Japan."

 jap.85.t: "Economic Open Doors with Russia!"
 jap.85.d: "After the signing of the treaty, bilateral trade between Japan and Russia saw a significant surge. Thanks to the reduction of tariff barriers and the gradual implementation of trade facilitation measures, Japan's exports to Russia achieved remarkable breakthroughs, particularly in sectors such as automobiles, electronics, and high-end machinery, with export volumes increasing significantly. At the same time, Russia's energy resources, including oil, natural gas, and coal, have been continuously supplied to Japan, greatly alleviating Japan's long-standing energy shortage.\n\nIn addition to the booming trade, cooperation in the investment sector between Japan and Russia has deepened and diversified. Japanese companies have participated in the development of multiple regions in Russia's Far East and Central Siberia, with investments spanning energy, infrastructure construction, agriculture, tourism, and high-tech industries. Meanwhile, Russian companies have increased their investment in the Japanese market, particularly in energy, minerals, and forestry, promoting a two-way flow of bilateral investments.\n\nIn terms of technological cooperation, the two countries have engaged in extensive collaborative research and technology exchanges. Especially in the field of robotics, Japan's technological expertise has been combined with Russia's market demand, leading to the development and practical application of several innovative products."

The official autopsy asserts that "the bullet went through Abe's upper left arm and damaged a blood vessel under his collarbone" and lists the official cause of death as "loss of blood."\n\nThe assailant, 41-year-old Tetsuya Yamagami, did not attempt to escape.

Other reports assert that Yamagami blamed the "certain organization" for having bankrupted his mother, who apparently donated a lot of money to the group.\n\nSpeculation about the identity of this "certain organization" is currently centered around The Unification Church. The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification-formerly called the Unification Church but perhaps best known as the church that "The Moonies" belong to-was founded by the Reverend Sun Myung Moon in 1954. Another organization that comes up in association with Abe (and with the Unification Church) is Nippon Kaigi. Described as the "largest and most powerful conservative right-wing organization".

 jap.98.t: "Korean-Japanese Partnership"
 jap.98.d: "With a grand victory over the Chinese aggressors in the Korean peninsula, we have accumulated a sizable amount of goodwill across the continent, those that fought with us as allies have seen us in a much more positive light, one of them being Korea.\n\nOur history with Korea has not always been positive, however the past is a block on both of our people's legs that is holding us back.With the amount of effort, resources, lives and funds invested into Korea, the question slowly arises on whether we might rekindle a new eternal friendship.\n\nThis of course is met with mixed responses, some are worried this is just another attempt at neo-imperialism while others don't see a point in adding their burdens onto ourselves. Obviously this will never reach the same levels as we did years ago, but there'll always be voices of protest. There are plenty that agree with this however, some seeing it as a clear message to the rest of the world that an attack on Korea is an attack on Japan, and a sign that our relations have properly healed.\n\nStill at the end of the day, a choice has to be made."
 jap.98.a: "Let's step over the past and create a new eternal friendship!" 
 jap.98.b: "We shouldn't go overboard with this..." 
 jap.99.t: "Shinzo Abe Returns to Politics!"
 jap.99.d: "After struggling with ulcerative colitis for a while, former prime minister Shinzo Abe has made a surprise announcement that he has returned to Japanese politics, this has generally been received as a positive event with the occasional detractor here and there expressing gloom over the potential scenario of a return to the status quo.\n\nThe LDP has welcomed him back with open arms and already Shinzo has made clear that he once again aims for the position of prime minister, hopefully this time with less health concerns."
 jap.99.a: "Return of the norm."
 jap.100.t: "Сurrent Goals of Army Modernization"
 jap.100.d: "The situation in the Taiwan Strait has escalated rapidly, and although the conflict has temporarily subsided, the performance of the Self-Defense Forces has revealed serious deficiencies, some of which are significant enough to threaten their core combat capabilities. If these issues are not addressed in a timely manner but rather ignored, our military's combat readiness will be difficult to maintain at its current level, and may even see a significant decline. Therefore, implementing comprehensive military modernization reforms is an urgent task that cannot be delayed.\n\nOur objective is no longer simply to rely on the Self-Defense Forces to defend Japan's homeland. Instead, we must transform them into a multifunctional, all-encompassing force capable of responding to complex international situations. In the wake of the collapse of the United States, it is evident that China's ambitions will not stop at Taiwan; their strategic expansion is gradually threatening the stability and security of the entire East Asia region. Japan must make strategic adjustments and comprehensively enhance the combat capabilities of the Self-Defense Forces, not only to defend its territory but also to acquire the ability to intervene in regional affairs. Only in this way can Japan play a key role in shaping the future order of the East Pacific."
 jap.100.a: "Let's get started!"
 jap.101.t: "State of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Forces"
 jap.101.d: "Report Title: Issues Exposed by the Ground Self-Defense Forces\n\nDuring the confrontation with China, the Ground Self-Defense Forces exposed several critical issues, such as disorganized command structures, insufficient equipment maintenance, and low morale in some units. These problems have severely impacted the combat effectiveness of the forces.\n\nIn the Taiwan War, joint operations among the army, navy, and air force revealed significant command and coordination problems. There was a lack of effective communication between army divisions, leading to fragmented operations, disordered attack rhythms, and missed opportunities. The root cause lies in the incomplete development of the joint operational mechanism among the three services, with the absence of a unified command and coordination structure. This resulted in delayed information transmission and difficulty in effectively implementing combat plans.\n\nInadequate equipment maintenance also seriously affected combat efficiency. For instance, some tanks and armored vehicles experienced engine failures, making them unable to operate; artillery pieces suffered barrel explosions due to poor maintenance; and personal weapons rusted due to moisture, rendering them unusable.\n\nLow morale and a fear of battle spread among some army units. Faced with fierce enemy resistance, certain units displayed a reluctance to fight, with some even deserting. After heavy bombardment from the enemy, some soldiers panicked and disbanded, which severely impacted the morale of other units."
 jap.101.a: "There is a lot of work to be done."
 jap.102.t: "State of the Japan Air Self-Defense Forces"
 jap.102.d: "Report Title: Issues Exposed by the Air Self-Defense Force\n\nOutdated Aircraft: Our primary fighter jets, such as the F-15J and F-2, have been in service for a long time, and their avionics systems and weaponry are outdated compared to the new-generation aircraft of the People's Liberation Army Air Force . This has placed our forces in a passive position during aerial combat, making it difficult to effectively counter the advanced PLAAF jets such as the J-20.\n\nInsufficient Drone Combat Capabilities: Our investment and research in drone warfare have been significantly lacking. The limited number and outdated performance of our current drones make it difficult to effectively counter the PLAAF's drone swarm tactics.\n\nInadequate Intelligence Gathering: At the onset of the conflict, our assessment of the PLAAF's capabilities was significantly flawed, leading to errors in tactical deployment. This reveals a clear deficiency in our intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities.\n\nWeak Electronic Warfare Capabilities: The PLAAF demonstrated strong electronic warfare capabilities during the conflict, effectively disrupting our radar and communication systems. Our response in the field of electronic warfare was inadequate, putting us at a disadvantage in information gathering and command and control."
 jap.102.a: "To Skies Unknown..."
 jap.103.t: "State of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces"
 jap.103.d: "The Taiwan war has revealed several deficiencies in the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Forces. If these deficiencies are not promptly addressed, they will severely limit its role in future regional conflicts and may even jeopardize its own security.\n\nThe primary issue is the lack of strategic foresight. The MSDF has long focused its strategic priorities on countering traditional maritime threats. However, its ability to anticipate and respond to new forms of warfare, such as hybrid warfare, information warfare, and cyber warfare in the context of modern conflict, is clearly insufficient.\n\nSecondly, there is a relative decline in military power. Despite the MSDF's possession of advanced vessels and equipment, its advantage is steadily diminishing in the face of the rapidly growing military capabilities of the People's Liberation Army . In recent years, the PLA Navy has undertaken large-scale commissioning of new destroyers, frigates, submarines, and aircraft carriers, significantly improving both the quantity and quality."
 jap.103.a: "Eventually, we will outshine them."
 jap.104.t: "Grand Military Parade in Tokyo"
 jap.104.d: "Today, Tokyo's streets were packed with thousands of people, all eager to witness the grand parade. The crowd, waving their Rising Sun flags, was filled with excitement and anticipation. This was the largest military parade Japan had seen in the 21st century, marking a moment for the nation to showcase its military power after decades of restraint under the Peace Constitution.\n\nThe parade began with the thunderous roar of F-35 fighter jets, painted in blue, streaking across the sky. Following closely behind was a formation of Type 10 main battle tanks, Type 99 self-propelled howitzers, and Type 89 infantry fighting vehicles, rolling through the heart of Tokyo, met with waves of cheers from the crowd.\n\nNext came the massive "Izumo" light aircraft carrier, escorted by several frigates as it slowly sailed through Tokyo Bay. On its deck were SH-60K anti-submarine helicopters and F-35B fighter jets.\n\nThe highlight of the parade was undoubtedly the Prime Minister's speech. Dressed in a black suit, the Prime Minister took to the podium under the gaze of the expectant masses.\n\n"For decades, Japan has adhered to its Peace Constitution, but the world today is far from peaceful. Terrorism, regional conflicts - these threats constantly loom over our safety."\n\n"Japan, as a beacon of democracy and freedom in Asia and the world, can no longer remain silent! We will break the chains, reclaim our responsibilities, and stand at the forefront of defending freedom and democracy in Asia!""
 jap.104.a: "Banzai!"
 jap.105.t: "Under the Rising Sun"
 jap.105.d: "Looking back, the roaring economic boom of the past has now become a fleeting memory, and the aftershocks of the bubble's collapse still ripple across the nation. The younger generation, gradually lost in the cradle of consumerism, has grown up surrounded by material desires, while their sense of national and cultural identity has quietly faded away in the daily comfort of life. Faced with multiple pressures such as economic stagnation and an aging population, we must admit that only by reigniting the flame of patriotism in the hearts of the people can we unite the nation and revitalize our spirit. Yet, the shadow of defeat in war, the constraints of the Peace Constitution, and deep reflection on militarism have made patriotism a sensitive and complex topic in Japan, leading to hesitation.\n\nHow can we inspire love for the homeland without awakening the specter of militarism? This remains an unresolved dilemma. There are many differing opinions within the government, with no clear consensus. Ultimately, the debates focus on whether to rearm Japan and adopt a stronger stance to reassert itself on the international stage and reclaim national glory.\n\nHowever, political discussions alone cannot truly touch the hearts of the people. We must seek answers deep within our culture. From the resilience of the Bushido spirit to the fleeting beauty of falling cherry blossoms, from the profundity of traditional arts such as tea ceremonies and flower arrangement, to the emotional resonance of modern pop culture like anime and video games - these can all serve as keys to unlocking the patriotic passion of the younger generation. Only by doing so can we awaken the deeply buried patriotic sentiment in our nation's new generation."
 jap.105.a: "As cherry blossoms swirl, the soul finds its way home."
 jap.106.t: "NHK Post-Taiwan War Report"
 jap.106.d: ""And that concludes our weather report, moving onto Fumiko with his report on Taiwan and the conclusion of the conflict, go ahead Fumiko."\n\n"Thank you, Akane, as you may see behind me, reconstruction of Taipei is well underway, after Japanese forces have conducted the peacekeeping operation in maintaining Taiwanese independence, some of our troops have are staying on this beautiful island, providing security and peace to the country until it has no need for them anymore."\n\n"However there have been concerns from our friends here and the good folks in Japan on whether this peacekeeping operation was for nothing more but the betterment of Japan, to this i strongly disagree with, our troops were present here to prevent the occupation of Taiwan by the hostile Chinese and to thwart any plans of future expansion into Asia, furthermore we are providing the resources Taiwan needs to rebuild so that they may be able to prosper again, this time they will be more relaxed with the immediate threat of conflict gone."\n\n"With our commitment to peace in Asia, we will make sure that the noble sacrifices our men and women made won’t be in vain, ensuring that the bright light of democracy keeps on shining."\n\n"No matter what critics may say, they are unable to deny that we have kept Asia in a state of peace""
 jap.106.a: "Thank you Fumiko, now onto sports."
 jap.107.t: "Within the Four Seas, All Men are Brothers."
 jap.107.d: "Mohamed mind could only drift away from the droning chores he was once so happy to do, thinking ever more of a homeland he was once so happy to have left, slowing his labour to dream about the highlands of his birth, or sometimes of the curry he had sealed for lunch.\n\nHe'd once been so happy to see the shores of Japan, the nation with very well groomed men on its banknotes, all very proper, western and possibly almost European. The nation with skyscrapers and clean streets, where there were seemingly no stray animals, a nation perhaps one day he could see himself with a full stomach; dazing lazily in the sunshine as remuneration for his toils.\n\nNary a thought spared on the way over to how he now struggled to read the writing, how he struggled to speak and how people met him with darting eyes rather than homely smiles, perhaps if he could work just one more week and take his pay... Perhaps if-\n\nSuddenly all thoughts overwhelmed by a blaring lunch whistle, and his thoughts were doubly overran by thoughts of food, quiet and fleeting rest.\n\nObserving a fleeing flock of seagulls, his eyes and head turned involuntarily towards the sound of well spoken, eloquent, fluent Japanese. Slightly out of breath, a man dressed as he was, spoke to him that "we are having a get-together with all the new workers at a bar nearby after work!" And with such a welcoming tone, Mohamed for the first time without anxiety, almost stammered out the words: "Yes, thank you.""
 jap.107.a: ""So, what are you having for lunch?""
 jap.108.t: "The Chatter"
 jap.108.d: "Kishi looked at Shinsato.  The rays of the sun were only now just settling into shadows under the trees beside them, but Kishi saw his companion's face clearly even through the glass of the Ramune at his lips. It evoked a memory of them sipping Coca-Cola on a bench in San Francisco a lifetime ago, salarymen of titanic spirits and brilliant intellects that wielded capital against their competitors.\n\n"America."\n\n"Hmm?" Shinsato relinquished his drink and looked at his friend curiously.\n\n"America, it looks like its all going to go up in smoke."\n\nEyes rolled and drink suppered without comment, still Kishi queried: "Do you think the stock exchange will recover? I'm down."\n\nThe glass was sheathed on the table and with an assuring light shining from a wry smile and alert eyes, Shinsato spoke: "Yes, I am certain everything will be okay for us, no need to worry like you usually do."\n\nKishi smiled in a way that surrendered his conscience to his friend, this expression of absolute trust apparent on his wrinkles, this he reserved for this man alone, as he had never been wrong before."
 jap.108.a: ""Yes. Everything will be fine.""
 jap.109.t: "Sharp arguments"
 jap.109.d: "Politics have never been that much of interest to the Japanese people but after the recent conflict in Taiwan, more and more people have been paying attention to Japan’s internal politics, between the campaigns and activism, the amount of viewers on political interviews have increased as well.\n\n"With all due respect Kato but article nine has proven time and time again that quiet pacifism is a fool’s errand, we were lucky to have fended off Chinese aggression to begin with, could you imagine if we did not have such a restrictive part of our constitution?"\n\nAnother day, another debate on "Live till morning!" which is hosted by Soichiro Tahara, he has introduced the viewers to both Sasaki from the conservative faction and Kato of the liberal faction, for a while the debate went by without any heightened emotions but when the issue around article nine arose, voices were raised.\n\n"Japan’s main goal in any conflict is to maintain the peace, you should know this by now Sasaki, we aren’t a nation of war, not anymore."\n\n"With this dedication to solely being on the defense, we had to face the brunt of Chinese hostilities, the Taiwan war has proven this an-"\n\n"But the conflict wasn’t a war?"\n\nSasaki went silent, a bit dumbfounded.\n\n"No no Sasaki, the Taiwan operation wasn’t a war, it was a peacekeeping operation, we weren’t on Taiwan to expand our territories nor to force our will on another independent nation, we were there to keep the peace on the island and to retain its sovereignty, Japan has abandoned its expansionist desires and with article nine, we will keep proving to the world that we do not sway from our intentions."\n\n"I mean yeah- i guess... When-" Sasaki stammered. "Taiwan’s defense is Japans defense." Kato smiled."
 jap.109.a: "Our intentions remain the same."
 
 jap.1000.t: "Fighting on the Korean Border!"
 jap.1000.d: "The flames of war once again scorch the Korean Peninsula, a land already deeply scarred by past conflicts, now turned into the battleground for ideological confrontation. The North's iron boots have mercilessly trampled the fragile balance of the 38th parallel, while the South's calls for help appear faint and powerless under the shadow of the red flag.\n\nIf Tokyo stands idly by and allows the communist regime to unify the peninsula, their next target could very well be Japan. Japan has always seen itself as the forward stronghold of democracy in Asia. As a defender of democracy, Japan not only has the obligation but also the responsibility to step up and help South Korea defend its hard-earned freedom and democracy, even if this comes at a great cost.\n\nThough there are dissenting voices within the government, the cries of the pro-war faction have quickly drowned out all opposition. Amid the clamor in the National Diet, the ships of the Self-Defense Forces have already cut through the waves, heading toward the last bastion of democracy on the Korean Peninsula. Fighter jets pierce the silence of dawn, and soldiers, fully armed, march forward with resolve and fearlessness in their eyes.\n\nNo one can predict the outcome of this war, nor can anyone say for certain whether Japan's choice is the right one. But everyone knows that the wheels of history have begun to turn, and no one can stop their forward momentum."
 jap.1000.a: "Separated by mountains and seas, bound by fate."
 jap.1001.t: "Japanese Intervention in the Korean War"
 jap.1001.d: "According to a report by Asahi Shimbun's correspondent in South Korea, intense firefights broke out early this morning along the border between North and South Korea. What started as a minor skirmish quickly escalated into a full-scale military confrontation. Both sides have accused the other of firing first, each claiming their actions were in self-defense. The fighting is ongoing, and casualty figures are yet to be confirmed. The conflict is said to have been triggered by a physical altercation between patrol units from both nations near the Demilitarized Zone, which escalated into gunfire.\n\nNorth Korea insists that South Korean soldiers first crossed the military demarcation line and provoked their patrol unit, forcing them to open fire in self-defense. In contrast, South Korea's Ministry of National Defense issued a statement accusing North Korean forces of an unprovoked attack on a South Korean patrol, prompting a necessary retaliatory response. According to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, North Korean forces used rockets and artillery to bombard South Korean border posts and military facilities. In response, South Korean forces launched counterattacks and deployed KF-16 fighter jets to conduct airstrikes on North Korean military targets along the border.\n\nMeanwhile, North Korea's official media issued a statement condemning South Korea's "acts of aggression" and declared that the Korean People's Army is ready at any moment to "crush the military power of the southern capitalist puppets.""
 jap.1001.a: "One more war..."
 jap.1002.t: "The Great Asian War"
 jap.1002.d: "Today, under the iron grip of the red tyrants, China, once self-proclaimed as the "Celestial Empire," harbors ambitions and silently extends its claws toward the surrounding territories. In the face of this oppressive force from the East, to defend Asia's freedom and democracy, Japan - once a fearsome samurai sword that struck terror into the world - has silently been unsheathed again. Under the radiant light of the Rising Sun Flag, 100 million citizens stand as one, united to resist the onslaught of the red tide, protecting the peace and prosperity of this land.\n\nFrom the towering peaks of the Himalayas to the boundless blue waves of the Pacific, we fight fiercely against the tyrants poisoned by communist ideology. With our blood and lives, we defend Asia's last remaining glory and dignity.\n\nWe are the inheritors of the samurai's legacy, with courage and fearlessness coursing through our veins like flames. No matter how perilous the path ahead, we will emerge victorious in this battle of destiny. When the cherry blossoms bloom again, it will mark the moment of our triumphant return."
 jap.1002.a: "Long live the Emperor, long live Japan!"
 jap.1003.t1: "A New Sun in the Sky"
 jap.1003.t2: "Bushido Ascendant"
 jap.1003.d1: "Old allies fall, new ones rise, and with the constant change that occurs in history, it would be inevitable that the weight of the past, present and future would weigh down on all of us.\n\nFirst the giant in the east splintered, divided by its many malices and frustrations. Then Europe has engaged itself in petrifying war that lit the world on fire once more.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before the dragon opened its maw and tried to swallow Taiwan whole, but the island would not stand alone. We fought with new and old allies, but the past had catched up to us, soon the dragon stomped on our forces, and the white sun burnt up in its flames.\n\nInternal strife came to be, brother against brother. But we rose above our trails, and corrected our errors. Once again we rekindled old friendships and we sharpened our blades against the dragon. After days of non-stop fighting, the dragon laid broken and defeated, peace was made and a veil of stability was cast over the continent.\n\nWith our tribulation done, and what is broken being healed, you too can enjoy a well earned rest."
 jap.1003.d2: "The lone warrior was not so alone when the dragon attempted to crush Taiwan with its claws. With its allies, we were able to beat the flying monstrosity back into its cave.\n\nYet, the scars it left behind remained, the cities were burning and our families were separated by this reckless violence. We learnt alot from this, we learnt to be prepared for anything and everything.\n\nWe relearnt the path of the warrior, we knew how to fight again.\n\nThis was a wise decision. Inevitably the dragon would try to drag the entirety of Asia into a fiery war again, driven mad by bloodlust and a desire for revenge, it spread its hateful fire all across the continent. Yet we stood ready, with our weapons ready and our heads together like a singular samurai. We aimed at the dragon's heart, and we slayed it.\n\nDefeated, the dragon would be washed away by the tide of history, and after that Japan will regain its place in the world."
 jap.1003.a: "Enjoy the shadow under the newly grown trees."
