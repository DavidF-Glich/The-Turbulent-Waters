 austrian_neutrality: "Austrian Neutrality"
 austrian_neutrality_desc: "After the end of the Second World War, Austria, alongside Germany, found itself on trial once more. However, through allied sympathies along with successful negotiations and further distancing from the Third Reich, Austria had found itself as an independent, reunited, and, most importantly, neutral nation unlike its brother to the north which the bipolar world order had taken the axe to.\n\nWith this newfound opportunity, the nation did not intend to squander it. Both the government and people have willingly upheld this agreement to both West and East to remain out of any geo-political matters in or out of Europe even twenty years after the collapse of the USSR. However, as the march of time continues, the memories of old have begun to fade, and with Austria joining the EU in 1995, the neutrality agreement is starting to be questioned. As a matter that is entrenched within the identity of the Republic, any change in course would require the approval of two-thirds of parliament or, more drastically, the complete rewriting of the Constitution."
 house_of_kurtz: "The House of Kurz"
 house_of_kurtz_desc: "Austria, just like any other nation around, has its fair share of shady politicians. Sebastian Kurz certainly falls into that category. Originally, Kurz had formed a government in late 2017 alongside the Freedom Party, however, it all came tumbling down in 2019 following the Ibiza affair, which reminded the nation that despite Austria being special on the world stage, it was just like the rest domestically.As everyone was coming to terms with the event of the setup, the country once again was thrown into another period of crisis when the government collapsed under the weight of the scandal. Despite what should have been the end for any politician's career, Kurz has seemingly rebounded from this like it was any other story in the news, with him winning another election and having his new cabinet come in, he seems invincible.\n\nHowever, the committee from the Ibiza affair is still investigating him, and should it finally pick up the pace or even evolve into something greater, the skeletons from Kurz's closet may still be his undoing, can Kurz keep his name clean?"
