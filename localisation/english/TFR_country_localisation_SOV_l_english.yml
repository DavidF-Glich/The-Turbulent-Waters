  SOV_New_Century: "Russian New Century"
  SOV_New_Century_desc: "A nation that occupies one eighth of the world's land. A nation that refuses to be a mere footnote in history. A nation with overseas territories and people that long to return. A nation that rejects Western hegemony in favor of a multipolar world order.\n\nWhile the past century has not been kind to us, it has also given us some of our brightest moments. As long as the Russian spirit lives on, we will continue to forge our own path."
  SOV_Ukrainian_Strategy: "The Neo-Nazi Problem"

Stalin and Khrushchev continued to sell Russian territory to Ukraine. Gorbachev directly triggered the collapse of the union, causing us to lose most of Eastern Europe.\nNow, as Ukraine is gradually falling into the abyss of fascism, President Putin will correct the mistakes made by the Soviet leaders, fulfill the obligations of a brother nation, eradicate neo-Nazism in Ukraine, and reunite Russia and Ukraine!"

  SOV_Sanction_Resistent: "Sanctions Resistant Economy"
  SOV_Sanction_Resistent_desc: "While corruption is still a big problem, the primary issue now is that we can no longer withstand the effects of Western sanctions.

  SOV_Our_Foreign_Politic_desc: "There are many people in the world, both inside and outside our country, who want at least the weakening of Russia, and at most, the destruction of Russia and all its connections in the world.

Due to the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the non-recognition of it by many countries as Russian, it slowly began to fade. We need to fix this, and our government has decided to create a Free Trade Zone in the Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol to attract investment to the region.."
  SOV_increase_censore: "Increased Censorship"
  SOV_increase_censore_desc: "In our country, many NGOs use the Internet to slander the government and pro-government structures. Why should we tolerate this and not react?

These, sometimes ancient, but deeply loved. Family trinkets bring warmth to the younger generation. \nOf course, every family has its own New Year traditions, but everyone is united by an atmosphere of kindness and care. May the happiness of mutual understanding always be in your home, helping you. Overcoming all difficulties and bringing different generations closer.

  russia.9.d: "Russia's political system is a mystery to Westerners, but aside from some \"national peculiarities\", there is nothing unusual about it. Russia has three largest political parties:\n£GFX_CPRF_logo Communist Party of the Russian Federation - Although the Soviet Union collapsed thirty years ago, many Russians are still immersed in socialist ideas and nostalgia for the past, and the inequality of the oligarchy itself has caused great dissatisfaction, so the Communist Party has remained the second largest party in Russia.\n\n£GFX_UR_logo United Russia - A party that has been in power for decades, it is also the party that holds the majority of seats in the State Duma and is the de facto presidential party. United Russia represents a new conception of Russia itself that goes beyond the past.\n\n£GFX_LDPR_logo The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia - Although it has \"liberal\" and \"democratic\" in its name, it is actually a nationalist and populist party with a leader who looks more like someone from a circus. If the communists wanted to rebuild a new Soviet Union, the Liberal Democratic Party wanted to rebuild a new Russian Empire. \n\nAll the parties can hardly agree on any issue except the overall vision of restoring the great Russia. They may argue until the sky is dark, but until one person - Vladimir Putin appears to unify them, he stands above everyone and coordinates them to cooperate. As long as he is in power, these parties will continue to play by the rules he sets. "

  russia.10.d: "In any country, there is a group of people who do not participate in the country's usual political activities, but try to organize their own political activities to check and balance official politics. From a historical perspective, this group of people in Russia is liberals. Although there are many other \"colors\" among them, liberalism is undoubtedly their backbone. Although they do not threaten the current national system to a large extent, their existence and growth may be harmful to our country. These Western lackeys are trying to lead Russia astray and do everything possible to prevent us from realizing our common ideals.\n\nGovernment agencies should monitor the growth of £GFX_RF_logo liberal opposition forces and use all feasible means to weaken and suppress their power and reduce their harm."

  SOV_heavy_sanctions: "Western sanctions"
  SOV_heavy_sanctions_desc: "Europe is our number one target. If it weren't for the West that encouraged globalization, we would have realized our dream of a multipolar world long ago.\n\nIt all started with the Yeltsin coup and the collapse of the inefficient Soviet system. The West promised to \"promote peaceful coexistence between the two countries\", but in reality they took advantage of the situation and divided up our scarred motherland.\n\nIt's a pity that Yeltsin believed the lies and led Russia to destruction step by step. Eastern Europe gradually succumbed to Western pressure. After Putin came to power, he cut off ties with Western countries, but it was too late. Almost all of Eastern Europe joined NATO, including the Baltic States, which were once legal Russian territory. From the mountains of Georgia to the towns of Lugansk and Donetsk, from the Baltic to the Kazakh steppes, we fought against globalization. At first, we succeeded. The Western lackeys realized that they could not prevent us from returning to the world stage, but soon they put pressure on us with economic sanctions and trade embargoes. Although our economy has been hit hard, it is still strong. However, if the embargo continues, the economy will collapse sooner or later, and then we will be at the mercy of globalization! Only a storm can stop all this, and the sooner that day comes, the better. What the people want is to end Western imperialism and revive Russia's glory! "
  SOV_The_Petrol_Economy: "The Petroleum Economy"
  SOV_The_Petrol_Economy_desc: "In economics, there is a concept called the 'resource curse', which means that while abundant natural resources bring income to a country, they also hinder the development of other economic sectors and give rise to a more authoritarian political system. Russia is a typical example: oil and gas, as the mainstay of the economy, have huge weaknesses, and because most of the related companies are state-owned, the fate of the people and even the entire country is dictated by the ever-changing oil prices."
  SOV_Putinism_Faltering: "Soft authoritarianism"
  SOV_Putinism_Faltering_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_putinism_faltering\n\n\n\n\n\nVladimir Putin has presided over Russia since the beginning of the 21st century. He played a major role in rebuilding the country after the collapse of the Soviet Union, both as president and, from 2008 to 2012, as prime minister to his protégé Dmitry Medvedev, solving a wide range of problems at home and abroad. But Putin's style of rule, known as \"soft authoritarianism,\" has its drawbacks, with political repression and centralization of power but little direct intervention, which has fueled opposition and allowed corruption to flourish. United Russia has had to compete with radicals for seats in the Duma, and riot police have been a regular feature of liberal protests. Despite its many flaws, the Putin regime has not seen them as problems, insisting on solving specific problems on a case-by-case basis."

Despite the Soviet Union's efforts to promote state atheism, there are still many believers in our country, especially in rural areas. Therefore, the Russian Orthodox Church has become one of President Putin's most powerful weapons. The Church can not only project the president's influence to the elderly and rural residents, but also attack the opposition and any immoral movements, such as the LGBT movement. In return, we recognize the dominance of the Russian Orthodox Church and restrict the development of other denominations. This way we can stabilize the support of the clergy, and the people can focus on their faith instead of criticizing the government all day long."

Corrupt party bureaucrats and unscrupulous entrepreneurs bought state-owned enterprises at bargain prices, concentrating economic resources in the hands of a few government allies. They worked to stay in power by fraternizing with the Yeltsin regime and engaging in back-door deals, which made them targets of public criticism after the 1998 national economic crisis. Although Putin has punished some of the so-called corrupt oligarchs since taking office, he has no intention of ending the system, and some have even further tightened their control over the Russian economy."

Today, as Western influences continue to move eastward, Russia's security continues to be threatened, and we must not let the tragedy of fascism repeat itself. Russia's powerful military is ready to keep the enemy at bay, crush the ambitions of the United States and the European Union, and defend its honor to the death.
