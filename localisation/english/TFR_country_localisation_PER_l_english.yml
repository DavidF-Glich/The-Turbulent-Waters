 iran.18.t: "Iran Intervenes in the Gulf Region"
 iran.18.d: "With the Saudi Civil War throwing the balance of power in the Arabian peninsula in absolute dissarray, the Iranians have taken the opportunity to secure their hegemony in the region. In an effort to secure the Strait of Hormuz, Iranian aircraft were seen flying sorties over Oman and the UAE, as a prelude for a land invasion. In key ports across Iran, satellite imagery has shown troop concentrations around landing craft. On National Television, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has announced his intentions to \"exorcize the western Satan from the holy lands of Arabia\", and issued a formal declaration of war to several gulf states. A few hours later, in broadcasts before their populations, the Presidents of the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait have announced that several of their airfields have already been crippled by Iranian missile and aircraft attacks, and announced that they have entered a state of war.\n\nInternational outrage is high, as this war defies the existing rules-based international order. However, the West stands paralyzed due to internal issues at home caused by the Saudi Civil War, and are hestiant to fight an all out war with Iran over the Strait of Hormuz, where Iran has a decisive tactical advantage. Nevertheless, it is clear that the existing international order which has been defined since the post-Soviet era is coming to an end."
