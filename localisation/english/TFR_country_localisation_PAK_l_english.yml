 PAK.6.t: "Indo-Pakistani War Goes Nuclear"
 PAK.6.d: "The ongoing conflict between India and Pakistan reached a catastrophic milestone today as both nations exchanged nuclear weapons, triggering a humanitarian and ecological disaster of untold proportions. World leaders have urged immediate de-escalation in light of the devastating consequences for both countries and the global community.\n\nThe conflict, which has persisted for months, saw tensions escalate to unprecedented levels as both nations engaged in a series of military confrontations along their disputed border. Analysts had long feared that the situation could spiral out of control, leading to a nuclear exchange between the two nuclear-armed neighbors.\n\nThe first nuclear detonation occurred near a major military installation in Pakistan, followed shortly by a retaliatory strike on Indian soil. Reports estimate casualties in the hundreds of thousands, with millions more affected by the radioactive fallout. The full extent of the destruction is still unfolding, with rescue efforts hampered by the chaotic conditions on the ground. This unprecedented crisis has raised concerns over the potential destabilization of the region and long-term implications for the global environment. Experts warn that the fallout could have a lasting impact on the climate, agriculture, and public health, potentially affecting billions worldwide. The world watches in horror as these two nations confront the consequences of their actions."

 PAK.7.t: "Indo-Pakistani War"
 PAK.7.d: "The Kashmir Conflict has reached it's boiling point as Indian Troops cross the line of control into Pakistan, igniting an all out war between the two countries. The Kashmir dispute has been a historically sensitive issue for both the Indians and the Pakistanis, and has been a point of contention in recent times as pro-Pakistani insurgents have been active in the area, which India alleges are funded by the Pakistani government.\n\nThe Crisis on the border first started with clashes between insurgents and Indian security forces in the region. As the Pakistani military mobilized a few days later to attempt to force a negotiation, the Indians responded in kind, soon turning the Indo-Pakistani border into the world's most militarized border.\n\nFor the first time in history, war between two nuclear powers has broken out, as the world prays that the atomic demon will not be let out of Pandora's box. Many Indian-backed insurgency groups such as the Balochistan Liberation Front and the Sindhudesh Liberation Army have risen up in active warfare to supplement the Indian advance. Regardless of the outcome, many predict that the death toll of the conflict will reach the millions."

 PAK.13.t: "New Delhi Peace Treaty"
 PAK.13.d: "Recently, under China's mediation, Pakistan and India, two major nations engaged in military conflict over the disputed Kashmir region, finally reached a ceasefire. The two countries are set to sign this peace agreement in New Delhi, the capital of India.\n\nThe dispute over Kashmir has led to several historical conflicts involving politics, religion, ethnicity, and military power. From an external perspective, this latest war is not only the culmination of escalating tensions between the two nations but also a continuation of long-standing historical issues. Both sides aimed to settle the matter once and for all through this military confrontation.\n\nAfter a prolonged period of warfare, with resources and patience depleted, both parties have returned to the negotiating table, agreeing to a full-scale ceasefire and signing the agreement, bringing temporary peace back to their respective territories."
 PAK.13.a: "At least both sides can claim victory."
