 militia_patrols: "Neighborhood Patrols"
 militia_patrols_desc: "Try as we might, it's becoming increasingly difficult to protect our state from internal subversion and lawlessness. It has been deemed necessary to create neighborhood patrols to protect our neighborhoods from this menace. Order will be enforced in the suburbs!"

 militia_curfews_desc: "Enforcing order is proving to be more difficult than we thought, and to curb the tide of anarchy extraordinary measures will have to be taken. A curfew will be set in place and anyone in violation will be subject to arrest. Remember, at 6:0, get the hell inside!"
 militia_censor_news: "Censor The News"
 militia_censor_news_desc: "Our militia has been derided by the press ever since we took power, simply for trying to enforce law and order!

 militia_pow_question: "Question Of POWs"
 militia_pow_question_desc: "All wars have prisoners, and this one is no exception. Our men capture more and more radicals every day, and some argue that we just can't take the strain on resources. Perhaps the POW camps should be, er, liquidated?"

Thankfully, there is no shortage of funds or able-bodied men willing to fight for them. It's time to let everyone know that we're now hiring!"

 militia_skies: "Dominate The Skies"

 militia_contracts: "Take On Government Contracts"
 militia_contracts_desc: "Money is often an issue for the militia, but thankfully the government has brought a solution forth. They'll give us an order, and we'll make sure it gets done. We've always been willing to fight for law and order, but getting paid for it wouldn't hurt!"
