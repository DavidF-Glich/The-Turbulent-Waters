 BLR_Rising_Zmagars_idea: "Rising Zmagars"
 BLR_Rising_Zmagars_idea_desc: "Liberals, dissatisfied with 'literally soviet like' Lukashenko regime, dubbed as Zmagars, have begun to quietly raise their voices in dissent to correct way of things, with many teenagers, who had never seen horrors of economic de-growth of 90s, flocking to them, in promises for west-like democracy and American way of life. They have no ability to sway all or bigger chunk of Belarus Population, of course, but if left unnoticed, it may lead to some dire and sad events transpiring."
 BLR_Lukashenkonomics_idea: "Lukashenkonomics"
 BLR_Lukashenkonomics_idea_desc: "Belarus' economic model is special among its post-soviet peers. Unlike all others, who had their Soviet economic base destroyed by 'Entrepreneurs', and privatized, annihilated by Shock Therapies. Belarus under Lukashenko, prevented for this to happen. To this day, Belarus has a large state sector that provides industrial growth, collective farms grow food, undisturbed by business optimization, and trade unions play large part in economic affairs of the country. Of course, controlled private property exist, but they little to no weight in political control of the country. What Lukashenko has built is in no way socialism, but this is as close as one can get in Post-Communist Eastern Europe"
 BLR_Lukashenko_rule_idea: "Lukashenko's Autocracy"
 BLR_Lukashenko_rule_idea_desc: "\n\n\n\n£GFX_BLR_Lukashenko_rule\n\n\n\n\n\nFor decades, Alexander Lukashenko ruled Belarus as undisputed autocrat. None were there to face him. Once Lukashenko sees minister slacking off; they will be removed without even a glimpse of advocatory action. Private industry disregarding the unions - nationalized, without the consultation. Cabinets come and go, but he remains to change them. Such method of rule has proven popular among average workers in population, who seek stability and order above all."
 BLR_Democratization_of_Belarus_idea: "Democratization of Belarus"
 BLR_Democratization_of_Belarus_idea_desc: "With tyrant gone we can finally free Belarus from his oppressive, pro-russian adminstartion! Our task is clear - free market reforms, ban on Russian language, liberal elections, EU and NATO membership!"
 BLR_Crushing_Zmagar_Opposition_idea: "Crushing Zmagar Opposition"

 belarus.1.t: "Election Results!"
 belarus.1.d: "As the polls draw to a close, it was declared that Mr Lukashenko won 80% of the vote, according to a preliminary count. Despite these incredible results, Protesters and riot police have clashed in Belarus's capital Minsk and other cities, after a state TV exit poll said long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was re-elected in Sunday's election. But the main opposition leader has refused to recognise the results. The preliminary results give her 9.9% of the vote, but her campaign said she had been polling 70-80% in some areas. Ms Tikhanovskaya entered the election in place of her jailed husband and went on to lead large opposition rallies."

 news.176.t: "Protests in Belarus"
 news.176.d: "'Massive' rights abuses and torture in Belarus have been condemned by an election-monitoring organisation with calls for a rerun of the country's August presidential polls in which President Alexander Lukashenko claimed victory. A report looking into the election and subsequent crackdown by authorities, published by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) on Thursday, said human rights abuses 'were found to be massive and systematic and proven beyond doubt'.\nThe vote was 'not transparent, free or fair' and it recommended the result to be annulled 'due to irregularities at all stages of the process', urging Belarus to "organise new genuine presidential elections based on international standards'. Lukashenko claimed victory in the election but tens of thousands of opposition protesters have since taken to the streets in a wave of protests."
 news.176.a: "Truly Troubling"
 news.177.t: "Russian Tanks Roll Into Minsk!"
 news.177.d: "As the Anti-Lukashenko Protests in Belarus continue to escalate and spiral out of control, something unprecedented occured as the Russian military poured into Belarus and began assisting the Belarusian Government in putting down protests by force.\nTanks were seen moving down the E30 highway and Russian helicopters have been noticed to be sweeping overhead major cities; causing a headache for many Belorussians on the roads. That was the least of problems however, as now there are open clashes in the streets between protestors and police now backed by Russian tanks. While Lukashenko hoped that this would help kill the mass protests sweeping his country, civil discontent has now exploded with many angry over foreign troops flaunting themselves on Belorussian soil. Some observers say that now Minsk is fully attached to Putin's fingers as a puppet of his ambitions."
 news.177.a: "The Russian Bear Roars Over Eastern Europe"
 news.178.t: "Russia Hit With New Sanctions"
 news.178.d: "Like a geopolitical synchronized swimming team of sorts, several Western Nations mostly consisting of NATO members have levied new sanctions on Russia today due to the bloody Belarusian intervention. These sanctions hurt several key Russian officals and figures affiliated with major Russian state corporations. With Russia already bearing the weight of several sanctions which have bogged down their economy since the mid-2010s, it is wondered how the Russian Federation will cope with these tighter locks of pressure from the West. The Kremlin has already issued it's own statement, condemning the sanctions as 'unilateral western imperialism'."
