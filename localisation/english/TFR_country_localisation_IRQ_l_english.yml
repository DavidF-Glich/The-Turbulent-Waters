Several commanders of the Iraqi army have declared their allegiance to various political and jihadist groups in the south - including the resurgent Islamic State, which has apparently seen a surge in numbers and popularity partially from the fleeing Saudi population and continued dissatisfaction with the government. The INIS have also made reports of troop movements on our border with Iran, with the director of our intelligence service going as far as to say that Iran may be preparing for intervention, all while what loyalists remain in our military have been ordered to violently put down the protests in Baghdad and to set up defenses in the city as the country is mere steps away from another civil war."

A peace agreement was hastily ratified at the village of Mandali on the Iranian border as combat on the frontlines could be heard merely a few miles away from the building with our and the Iranian diplomats.
