romania.1.t: "The Romanian Legislative Elections Of 2020"
romania.1.d: "The Romanian legislative elections of 2020 are being held in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic which has hit our country hard as well as rising anti-establishment sentiment mainly due to the huge corruption scandals during the rule of the Social Democratic party (PSD) in the past three years. Nevertheless the PSD still is a big force in Romanian politics and it's election could be likely as there is rising discontent towards the mimority government led by the National Liberal Party (PNL) under Ludovic Orban which took power last year when the Social Democratic Party's government fell in a motion of no confidence. The 2020 elections are the most crucial out nation had in recent years and whoever wins will take the country in a vastly different direction."
