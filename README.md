# The-Turbulent-Waters

All mod development modifications shall be commited in non-default branches. integration into main-branch is Author's job.
Also before you update the branch, notify me and the all code members who has access to the directory.

Dev Principle:
1. Add Powerful Ai strategies > Mars equipments > Mars manpower > Mars Divisions > Hidden Buffs
2. Develop it as an individual mod, NOT a submod. We'll try to fit it into a TFR submod again when a near-official version is ready. However, don't expect a success from such adaptations since too much modifications exist between TTW and TFR.
