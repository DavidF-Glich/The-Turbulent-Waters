# The-Turbulent-Waters

All mod development modifications shall be commited in non-default branches. integration into main-branch is Author's job.
Also before you update the branch, notify me and the all code members who has access to the directory.

Dev Principle:
1. Add Powerful Ai strategies > Mars equipments > Mars manpower > Mars Divisions > Hidden Buffs
2. Develop it as an individual mod, NOT a submod. We'll try to fit it into a TFR submod again when a near-official version is ready. However, don't expect a success from such adaptations since too much modifications exist between TTW and TFR.
3. Make sth. new. Don't just stay in the TFR framework. Embrace GUIs.

Powerful tools recommended (possibly required) for developers:
Draw.io - Content Designer
GIMP - dds file editing
Photoshop - Advanced picture Editing
VSC/Cursor + CWtools & VModers & HOI4 Mod Utilities (App + Plug-ins) - Code Check
